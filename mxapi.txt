ac_find ac_add

msg_open msg_open_new msg_commit msg_close msg_padding_size

path_probe path_canon path_pretty path_parent

kill path_pretty?

contract depends on function
msg_* needs everything, tags_* too

mxapi guarantee includes
	m->hdrs
	m->v2r

path $trash, resolve -> M(magic, path, real, ops)
	flag as minimal?
how to get from M(min) to M(full)
	only with an open()

open_* take M(min)
check,sync take M(min) -> trigger open()
	msg_* too?  ∀ BE?  tags?
probe is one-off fn, seldom used
canon(M, path) path is optional?
path_parent may need A for separator

how does pretty() deal with decoration?
	it can't work on canon - might differ from user-visible path
	does BE remove decoration from folder?

if fn requires M(min) - no checks required
if fn requires M(full) check flag, check connection

what does pretty need?  M, A for delim!
can we change the definition/usage of $folder -- kill decoration
	then let mxapi strip path?
if path is just relative path, then we need to manipulate $folder after it's set

need mxapi trash function - two variants
	sibling mailboxes - fast_trash()
	non-sibling mailboxes - copy_trash()

mxapi add
	mbox_create()
	mbox_delete()
create needs a parent M or an A
	how?
	have *root* M?
delete takes M
API asks for name, not BE
future need api completion for
	COMP_CREATE
	COMP_DELETE
	etc

mxapi
	should path_probe match based on M->desc?

mxapi standard error codes?
	MXAPI_SUCCESS 0
	MXAPI_WARNING -1
	MXAPI_ERROR   -2
	MXAPI_FATAL   -3
	MXAPI_CODE    -99
add backend specfic codes?
	MXAPI_CUSTOM_SUCCESS{1..5} {11..15}
	MXAPI_CUSTOM_WARNING{1..5} {-11..-15}
	MXAPI_CUSTOM_ERROR{1..5}   {-21..-25}
backend can create their own enum (for internal use?)

MXAPI_CODE used when requires parameters are missing,
	but not when X_free() is called with a NULL ptr

need a success/error macro
	which is warning?

error is a fail
what is a warning?
	success with message?

#define names for 0, -1
	SUCCESS, ERROR
	∀ functions?
	or enum to distinguish from "int"
	start with just mxapi functions
		MX_SUCCESS, MX_WARNING, MX_ERROR

mxapi add?
	mbox_new() is there new mail?
	mbox_empty() is there any mail?

move index_format to mx API?
	needed by notmuch and help
	have default?
	how are notifications handled?

need API fn to move a message
	between mailboxes on same account
	between mailboxes on different accounts
copy message fn too?
what other primitives?
