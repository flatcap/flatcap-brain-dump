compose refactor

upstream duplicate lots of config
	214 bools
	25 quad
	9 others

compose dlg+windows
data local to dlg
View data, Constructed Email
sub = N->sub (global config)

<background>
	save config to new Sub
	what happens to the Dlg
	can't pop it, need to hide it

<restore>
	need postpone-like menu
	show window (sub = scoped)
	how is ":set X" handled?
	command is global, sub isn't
	":set" show compose config?  how?

<background> hide window
<send> send email
	clear up sub, tmpfile

backgrounded composes and current index are effectively *tabs*

<show-tabs> button
overwrite top line with names
or show popup menu with names
<show-tabs>i = index
	what about multiple indexes?
<show-tabs>1,2,3 composes
is 1 first compose, or most recent?
background, chronological or most-recently-used
MRU confusing

function to create new Index
how is ":set X" handled?
index-specific? or global?
needs its own sub

Root
	Dlgs (Index)
	Msg (Compose)
	Cli  Index still separate

Index (1)
(Compose1) (2)
(Compose2) (3)
(Compose3) (4)

tab_format_string %To, %Subject, etc

:cmd in compose, use *our* sub
	=> can't do global stuff!
or does it?  only override *send* cfg in *sub*
rest drops through
