lists - what does toggle view do?
who handles sorting?
where does the context-sensitive help come from?
function: select-view-X
search is limited to ONE SRC
	SRC-search has pointer to mail search
Addresses, Tasks -- multiple tags on items => nesting doesn't make sense
	Both could have dynamic folders like notmuch
	Dynamic grouping / ephemeral new groups
rss - 1 SRC per feed, 1 folder per SRC
Some view with multiple SRCs may want a horizontal divider
	others (e.g. RSS) won't
Is help-page a top-level VIEW?
What does each View, SRC, Folder, Item represent for each view type?
What functions need to be delegated?
What config needs to be inherited/delegated?
What does the alternate view show?

Views give me a clear owner
	=> mouse location obvious
	=> key handling easier

Change address(es|book) to contact(s)?

Need to rethink rss
	groups/tags need to be above the feeds (in obj hierarchy)

unique ids âˆ€ objects

config manager
	stores all values
	uses CRC on config names for easy comparison
	config reader delegates to each plugin

need to be able to move items (of the same type) between different sources
	e.g. between different mail servers

Contacts/Tasks/Calendars - Display:
	tags - each item has zero/one/mulitple tags
	simulate hierarchy?
		tag=FRUIT
			tag=(FRUIT&CAR)
			tag=(FRUIT&ANIMAL)
		tag=COUNTRY
	Contacts/Tasks/Calendars config
	contacts_tags -- like mailboxes command
	contacts_hierarchy -- group tags like folders

rss
	metafolders
		starred/flagged
		archived
		recently read
		all articles
		fresh articles (<24h)
	requires backend cache of articles
	labels/colours
