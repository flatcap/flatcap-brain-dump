lists - what does toggle view do?
who handles sorting?
where does the context-sensitive help come from?
function: select-view-X
search is limited to ONE SRC
	SRC-search has pointer to mail search
Addresses, Tasks -- multiple tags on items => nesting doesn't make sense
	Both could have dynamic folders like notmuch
	Dynamic grouping / ephemeral new groups
rss - 1 SRC per feed, 1 folder per SRC
Some view with multiple SRCs may want a horizontal divider
	others (e.g. RSS) won't
Is help-page a top-level VIEW?
What does each View, SRC, Folder, Item represent for each view type?
What functions need to be delegated?
What config needs to be inherited/delegated?
What does the alternate view show?

Views give me a clear owner
	=> mouse location obvious
	=> key handling easier

Change address(es|book) to contact(s)?

Need to rethink rss
	groups/tags need to be above the feeds (in obj hierarchy)
