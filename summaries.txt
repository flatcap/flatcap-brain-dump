Vim-style
	:set     → show all modified vars
	:set all → all all vars
	:unset === set novar

:set -> pager full of settings
	list name, value, default value

:set VARIABLE=MAGIC_TOKEN => set VARIABLE to its default value
	save that default value in the history

:messages [clear]
	all messages, or limit to 100?

:bind / :macro / :???
	list bindings / macros

:color
	list all colours

:scriptnames
	list all config files that were loaded
	red-flag any with errors
	add cli option?  to save memory otherwise

for :set, etc how does help work when it overlays the pager?
	create a sample command
	then use the rest of the ideas for mentoring

:messages
	record progress bar info too, e.g.
	100% 3:45
	57% 1:24 cancelled

:messages should take ${read,write,net}_inc into account

:version in pager
	like vim's version
	or mutt -v command line
