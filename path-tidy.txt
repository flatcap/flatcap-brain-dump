path_tidy()

absolute paths only
relative paths are complicated
	esp. if they start ../

1) filter out simple stuff
	`(/.)+/` -> `/`
	`//+` -> '/'

1st pass through, use 2 ptrs
	(r)ead
	(w)rite
need to check for both `/.$` and `/$` -- trim

2nd pass - /aaa/../ccc

while (strstr(..))
	insert NUL, then strrchr(/)
	memmove(x,y) move end of string back

1st pass could use strchr(/) to skip quickly
