travis - tag the latest successful build?

travis:
	15 x old features - updates only on backported code
	15 x new features - updates seldom (existing features)
	2 x mutt (default, stable) => full set of config options (updates often)
	2 x neomutt => full set of config options - updates - old: seldom, new: often
	pull-requests - seldom -> often

TRAVIS_BRANCH          For builds not triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch currently being built; whereas for builds triggered by a pull request this is the name of the branch targeted by the pull request (in many cases this will be master).
TRAVIS_BUILD_DIR       The absolute path to the directory where the repository being built has been copied on the worker.
TRAVIS_BUILD_ID        The id of the current build that Travis CI uses internally.
TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER    The number of the current build (for example, “4”).
TRAVIS_COMMIT          The commit that the current build is testing.
TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE    The range of commits that were included in the push or pull request.
TRAVIS_JOB_ID          The id of the current job that Travis CI uses internally.
TRAVIS_JOB_NUMBER      The number of the current job (for example, “4.1”).
TRAVIS_OS_NAME         On multi-OS builds, this value indicates the platform the job is running on. Values are linux and osx currently, to be extended in the future.
TRAVIS_PULL_REQUEST    The pull request number if the current job is a pull request, “false” if it’s not a pull request.
TRAVIS_REPO_SLUG       The slug (in form  owner_name/repo_name) of the repository currently being built. (for example, “travis-ci/travis-build”).
TRAVIS_SECURE_ENV_VARS Whether or not encrypted environment vars are being used. This value is either “true” or “false”.
TRAVIS_TEST_RESULT     is set to 0 if the build is successful and 1 if the build is broken.
TRAVIS_TAG             If the current build for a tag, this includes the tag’s name.

Disabling the Subsequent Test Run

Due to the way that Travis CI addons operate, your standard script stage (i.e.
your tests) will run after the Coverity Scan analysis completes. In order to
avoid this, you can modify your script directive in .travis.yml.

The COVERITY_SCAN_BRANCH environment variable will be set to 1 when the
Coverity Scan addon is in operation. Therefore, you might change your script
from

script: make

to

script: if [ "${COVERITY_SCAN_BRANCH}" != 1 ]; then make ; fi

only features*/*, neomutt* + pull-requets
+ mutt/* NO, not 1.5.24, 1.6.0 (fixed)

exceptions for anything with a configure option

fast-finish: true?

test qdbm - when travis whitelists it

travis for mutt/default, mutt/stable both refer to sidebar & notmuch!

travis PR -- env EVERYTHING var

travis libcaca includes libslang ∀ travis

group travis builds to cut out vm time

quick build -> travis

travis doc build (one-off)?

travis for OSX, catch build issues

unstable branch just one BIG travis build

compress missing from coverity OPTS

travis cache configure output for any given option set (it's constant)
	what files are generated?
	which are used?
	Makefile * n + config.h
	update cache if configure/Makefile are newer
	how do file timestamps fit in with git & caching?
1 configure set ∀ 43 builds
quiet build vs verbose build
	configured by website global var?
quiet by default?
hash configure options string as a filename in cache
alter prepare to use ./configure or configure-fast
	dependent on web global var?
one BIG build => option sets in file?
	in web env?

travis build:
	get latest build-script from github

neobuild in dot dir?
	separate repo?
	pull in (mycache)?

what should we build on a new tag being pushed?
	tags => neomutt release => full spread?

clone depth for [bugs/*] needs to be greater than 3
	(in case more than 3 bugs are pushed in one go)

sync travis-build scripts to neomutt-old branch names

run on patchsets
	construct & build
	2 builds (all, nothing)
	∀ distros

split "make distcheck" configure options out of build.sh
