try to centralise all curses calls
need to capture WINCH, move cursor, write char/string, set attrs, clear line/end/bottom/screen

after each move,  call getyx to confirm positions }- in case of writing/moving beyond screen
after each write, call getyx to confirm positions }

screenshot command with ANSI escape sequences / HTML+CSS
	multiple => screen cast

capture at screen or window-level?
	windows have no relationships, so screen for now
