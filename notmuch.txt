new notmuch command
	<goto-folder> -- open the maildir of the message
	and magically select the correct email in the index
	query syntax? ?mid=[MESSAGE-ID]

notmuch should use maildir machinery to open msgs, etc
	path -> Account -> Mailbox -> ops

bug
	notmuch + mail_check_stats leads to many expensive queries

notmuch feature docs need updating
	ask notmuch team for help

notmuch folder-hook's don't work fully:
	virtual-mailboxes "a" "notmuch://?tag:dnssec"
	doesn't match tag:dnssec
	tag%3Adnssec does match
	need to make the URI cleartext

notmuch: what do users do externally?
	can these actions be done using NM API?
	before neomutt -> startup-hook
	periodic -> timeout-hook
	after neomutt -> shutdown-hook
	what do we need to do?
	where would the code fit in?

requirements?
	NotMuch >= 4.3.0

drop notmuch checks -- assume newer version?

notmuch:
	nm_get_all_tags() is called twice (once to count, then once to build the list)

virtual-mailboxes => notmuch
	=> don't need "notmuch://"
	or even "?query="

run notmuch new from mutt when new mail arrives
	necessary? or not?

merge notmuch
	"named-mailboxes" command
	can describe sb entry
	how to nest virtual?
	sb obtion: display real, virtual, all mailboxes
	nest -> fake mailboxes
		named-mailboxes name [NOTHING]

21:04 <bremner> I too would be interested in a page comparing neomutt's notmuch support with notmuch-mutt (the perl hack that ships with notmuch)

notmuch tag-completion:
	when using -XYZ<tab>
	only match tags that exist on the selected mail(s)

unnamed notmuch queries => create description based on query
	need rename function for sidebar-notmuch
	need option to autoadd them to the sidebar

notmuch
	add new virtual folders to sidebar
		automatically?
	what name should it be given?
		automatic?
			allow user rename?
		ask user?
	how can we make them persistent?

notmuch.path = full notmuch://?query
notmuch.realpath = notmuch://path/to/db?query

l - limit by notmuch or have notmuch pattern

rename notmuch files to nm_, lose mutt_ too

nm queries
	?name=XYZ
	?desc=XYZ
		for a named query
	?subscribe[=yes]
	?persistent[=yes]
		for session-permanence?
	equivalent to "mailboxes ^"
	are options needed?  useful?

would notmuch be able to filter out muted conversations?
	No, not unless we change headers and notify notmuch

notmuch backend: add X-Label in editor, does "right thing" in notmuch?
unified frontend interface (notmuch/keywords) backend
one-direction script -- sync nightmare?
sync notmuch -> X-Label's?  get out of sync

notmuch doesn't use the header cache
to do so effectively, it would need to piggy-back on the maildir backend
currently, there's only one for all maildir dirs
notmuch might need to keep a reference count on the Account, Maildir and Emails

change functions to use enums (if they go back far enough in the history)
	notmuch_query_set_omit_excluded(query, 1);
		1 => NOTMUCH_EXCLUDE_TRUE
