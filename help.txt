Help Browser - Add new config

> The Help Browser is a new feature to bring online help to NeoMutt.
> The code is in the [devel/help](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/devel/help) branch.
> 
> It adds a new config variable: `$help_doc_dir` which should point to a copy of the [`test-doc`](https://github.com/neomutt/test-doc) repo.
> Help can be activated by pressing <kbd>Alt-H</kbd>

### Part 1

Add a new config variable `$help_index_format` to format the index list appropriately.

Tasks:
- Add config variable to `init.h`
- Add global variable to `help.[ch]`
- Alter `index.c` to use the new global

### Part 2

Add a new config variable `$help_simple_search` to search the help.

When a user searches for a string, but doesn't use a NeoMutt pattern, the string is transformed using [`$simple_search`](https://neomutt.org/guide/reference#simple-search).
This isn't appropriate for the help.

Tasks:
- Add config variable to `init.h`
- Add global variable to `help.[ch]`
- Alter `pattern.c` to use the new global

The final part is a little trickier.  The pattern function doesn't know if this is a 'help' mailbox.

There are a couple of possible solutions:
- Pass the 'simple_search' variable in as a parameter
- Expand the search using 'simple_search' before calling

Help Browser - Modernise the directory traversal

> The Help Browser is a new feature to bring online help to NeoMutt.
> The code is in the [devel/help](https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/tree/devel/help) branch.
> 
> It adds a new config variable: `$help_doc_dir` which should point to a copy of the [`test-doc`](https://github.com/neomutt/test-doc) repo.
> Help can be activated by pressing <kbd>Alt-H</kbd>

Task:
- Replace the directory traversal with the `nftw()` function
  It's the modern replacement for the `readdir()` function.

There is some sample code in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/flatcap/f0ee75ee26b30a8cade75c37b55419b5)
