Folder interface - struct Folder

bool is_mine(char *name)
	identify a URL as belonging to given mx

F* parse_uri(char *name)
	uri -> opaque object

struct Folder
{
	int type;
	char *canonical;
	[PRIVATE]
}

should the type be visible?
or a list of function pointers?

Does an mx support more/less than 1 Folder type?
	NO.  == 1

char* F_to_string(F*, flags)
	render to a string
	flags: canonical, abbreviated

void free_F(F*)
	release a folder

F* get_parent(F*)
F** get_children(F*)
F* get_root(F*)
F* get_prev_sibling(F*)
F* get next_sibling(F*)
	navigate folder hierarchy
	if applicable

bool match_regex(F*, regex, flags)

Folder owners/types
	mbox - File
	maildir - Folder set (nested)
	nntp - URI (nested)
	imap - URI (nested)
	notmuch - URI
	compressed - File

Navigation functions belong on mx

In a heterogeneous env, which type of browser do we launch?
imap folder/account => imap browser
compressed file => what?
	just dirs & matching '*.xz'?
	anything matching 'open-hook'?

need browser menu to be able to search other known mx
can only search imap if we have the account details
browser might list multiple imap accounts

Menu
	imap host[:port] user
	imap other[:port] user
	compressed }
	maildir    }- do we distinguish between these?
	mbox       }    => "local fs"
	nntp server[:port] [user]

In a generic file browser can we highlight matching folders?
	compressed: YES
	maildir: YES
	mbox: NO (would need to read file)

imap, nntp have subscriptions whose view can be toggled
turn nntp long list into folder hierarchy

notmuch browser
	subscribed => all virtual mailboxes
	not subscribed => tags/  what else?
		tags/ fake dir of all tags
		people/ fake dir of all people (too many?)

subscribe/unsubscribe => mailboxes/unmailboxes on folder
	=> will appear/disappear from sidebar
what about named mailboxes?
function to save subscribed mailboxes?

local file/dir browser
subscribed => all "mailboxes" known (and dirs)
not subscribed => normal files/dirs

browser - no advantage to the sidebar being visible?
	should be hidden
	unless visible to show the user their subscribed folders?
		or just highlight them in the browser
