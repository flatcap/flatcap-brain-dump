------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:

Does sidebar own window or vice versa.  YES, former
When I "set sidebar_visible = yes" what events happen?
Config validates, sets, notifies whom?, N, then what?
ComponentList { sidebar } -> sidebar_init(), listen to N
Sidebar listens to change-mailbox
	doesn't repaint, just marks window dirty?
Status bar initialised like sidebar
Bundle notifications
	start()
	lots of things
	end()
Each notify target needs list of children?
	or a function to enumerate them
lua callback ∀ notifications

------------------------------------------------------------

Bundle notifications
1)
	get_uid()
	send(ev, bundle_id, ...)
	send negative bundle_id to end
	useful for threads, complicated otherwise
2)
	bundle_start()
	...
	bundle_end()
	good if list takes a while to compile
3)
	notify(event*LIST*)

is list cached until complete?

------------------------------------------------------------

Cases:
	populate index/sidebar for first time -> multiple notifications
	new mail - want to know ALL details, A, M, E (bundled)

------------------------------------------------------------

N,A,M,E listener

Listen to N (EventType, flags, callback function, data)
L knows its parent
does it care about children? NO propagates upwards

Notifier (Type, parent, LIST(listeners))
type only needed for debugging?
opaque type: event(obj->notifier, event type, data)
add listener, remove listener, event

callback (event, flags, object, data)
N-objects N, A, M, E - ~16 objects (4 bits) enum or flags?
each object could have 28 distinct events?
or
FLAG_RECURSIVE|FLAG_ALL_EVENTS to mop up
need event structs
ENewMail { M, EL }
EWinch { w, h } or { ow, oh, nw, nh } old,new

Sidebar
	new account }__ repeat for startup
	new mailbox }
	del account }__ unmailboxes
	del mailbox }
	select mailbox
	select account
	winch

notification interface
	each object should start with "int type;"

notifications
	Config attached to N
	what about A-specific changes?
	CfgAccount needs A ptr - changes notify A, not N
	BE_init() -> listen to N
	notify(new A)
	BE listen_to(A, recurse)

multiple notifications
	one on each M that's changed
	plus, one on A -> STATS_CHANGED
	one on N, too?  ACTIVITY?

------------------------------------------------------------

Index
loops waiting for key input
	km_dokey(MENU_MAIN)
	triggers timeout

start with passive panels / listeners
- status bar
- help?
- sidebar?
- new mail command

------------------------------------------------------------

status listens to Config, AME?
does status *need* any GUI code?
	just format string to specification
	not worth splitting

listener function for events
gui function to display in window
txt function to format string

need status_init() too
	status_shutdown() - not nec for passive panels

menu/screen repaint just displays cached string
	(only when all deps that might change display are events)
unless:
- forced (Ctrl-L)
- WINCH
- NAME event

status also handles terminal stuff
	ts_status, ts_icon

status format also needed by NewMailCommand
	separate source code
	use status format fn
	new mail is passive

when event-driven, status could be farmed out to Lua!
	access to AME objects, expando_fmt(), add_color()/attr()

------------------------------------------------------------

need to rename struct Event out of the way

status needs Context too -- pattern
attach Neo version to N object
status cache Context, AME (current)
M needs A-ptr for A-priv data
does E need M-ptr?
	do they have a unique parent? PROB NOT
	what about notmuch (multiple views of same E)
so status needs Context + NAME

add 6th debug level for notifications

------------------------------------------------------------

new mail - how do %f - mailbox and %n - num new work?
	can't use status' fmt fn
use fake mailbox? NO
have custom format fn that delegates to status fmt

NewMail event only has {M,EL}
	%n - num new
	%f - mailbox
most status expandos are meaningless for new mail

------------------------------------------------------------

hooks - folder-hook on Account?
most listeners will need to watch N recursively
all hooks/focus on N?
same with window
nobody care about a specific window?
	except the painter
	status listens to status_window for WINCH
who's listening to M?  index is
NewMail needs to listen for (M,recurse) on N
on SIGWINCH, notify all windows, breadth first
how to prevent multiple notifications to a single window owner
recursive listeners need to filter out dupes.  HOW?  hash?!
A,M,E-hook change of focus - start at N

Have event structs ∀ events?
even if only delivering a ptr
that way we can version the events
helpful for Lua scripts, etc -- not code dependent

Who owns A-hooks?  N?

------------------------------------------------------------

NAME

N static or dynamic?  Dynamic
create early in init
add children as they become event-enabled
events: startup, shutdown, A-add
parent NULL

∀ sub-systems init() - allow them to listen to N
status: add_listener(N,A|ADD, ONLY, callback, data)
-> LL (listener list) += {subject, flags, callback, data}

rc mailboxes XYZ -> A-new, M-new
account-hook, A-add, M-add

will config become dependent on libnotify?
	config -> libnotify -> libmutt?

no more shutdown code
	code listens for notify(N,DEAD)
------------------------------------------------------------

unmailboxes

∀ M.EL notify(M,E-del)
	except where refcount > 1, e.g. notmuch
	if user's in pager need to notify email first
M -= EL
notify(A, M-del)
A -= M
if empty(A) notify(N,A-del)
N -= A

------------------------------------------------------------

index (via init) -> parse_unmailboxes
resolved to an M
notify(M, HIDDEN/UNSUB)
calls remove(A, M)
remove M from A.ML
M.release() (may be other users?)
release - dec refcount, if zero
∀ EL, release(E), if zero
notify(E, DEAD)
remove E from EL
free(E), NULL
notify(M, DEAD)
remove M from ML
free(M), NULL
if empty(A) remove(N,A)
∀ ML, release(M)
notify(A,DEAD)
remove A from AL
free(A), NULL

------------------------------------------------------------

Array of emails
FOREACH on E.notify

on unmailboxes, who decides new focus?
on del mail, who decides new focus?
on del account, who decides new focus?

on E-DEAD, which M do we notify?

notmuch returns 1000 paths, then what?
currently that's ONE A, if it's open
if not, open '/'
A.add_results -> A.ML.EL
	depth first search for matching mailboxes
	what about missing 'cur/'?
notmuch's A is HIDDEN/UNSUB
account A -> VISIBLE/SUB'D
notmuch just lock (rc+1) all maildir A's!
what about M's?  listen for user, add our own

Each VIEW needs to addref the object it's watching

------------------------------------------------------------

mailboxes DIR
resolve -> failed
create M, canon
find A -> failed
create A -> notify(N, new A)
add M -> notify(A, new M)
mbox_open() -> notify(M, add E * n)

only *new* E, when <sync-mailbox>
