make them all robust -- check all pointers

mx_lock_file
mx_unlock_file
mx_unlink_empty
mutt_decrease_mtime
mutt_set_mtime
mutt_touch_atime
	have nothing mx-related in them
	move to lib_file.c?

promote lib_file.c to libfile.a
	unify all the tmp-file functions, two sorts:
		care if file is lost (e.g. compose)
		don't care if file is lost (e.g. cached email)

need iconv library for conversion
*isolate* and library-fy maildir/mh
	split into many files

need to centralise the wide-character routines
	many are tainted by curses

mutt_make_date -> lib_date?
	find out the name for that particular date standard

split up big files even if it means making static functions non-static

sha1 is only used by pgppubring (soon to be obsolete)
move tools to /tools
