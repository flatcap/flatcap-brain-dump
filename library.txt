make them all robust -- check all pointers

promote lib/file.c to libfile.a
	unify all the tmp-file functions, two sorts:
		care if file is lost (e.g. compose)
		don't care if file is lost (e.g. cached email)

need iconv library for conversion
*isolate* and library-fy maildir/mh
	split into many files

need to centralise the wide-character routines
	many are tainted by curses

split up big files even if it means making static functions non-static

move tools to /tools

try to de-prefix lib functions
	mutt_buffer_X -> buffer_X

rfc822.c
	meaning?

sendlib.c
	all the b64 stuff

find_first_file from a list, e.g.
	/etc/muttrc locations
	/etc/mime.types locations
	~/.muttrc locations

fork() - 6 separate calls

hdrline.c
	get_nth_wchar -> mbyte_table.c

send.c
	remove_user -> address.c

mbox.c
	mbox_reset_atime refactor over lib/file
