<toggle-quoted> command

toggle_quoted_show_levels

> xxx
> > yyy
> > > zzz

perhaps change to config *variable*

- hide_quoted (bool)
- hide_quoted_level (int)

<toggle-quoted> doesn't persist between emails

hide_quoted would persist between emails

this would lead to problems with user feedback
they won't know when something's been hidden

> xxx
> > [4 lines hidden]

unless the number is large, this might lead to a lot of clutter

alternatively, we could use an expando in the status bar

[%Q lines hidden]

combine with status-colour feature for highlighting
