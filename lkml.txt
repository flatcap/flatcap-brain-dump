LKML git email backend
requires libgit
readonly
<sync-mailbox> does "git pull"
combine several git repos
need to teach notmuch how to parse git repo (or fake it)
lkml assistant - autolink lore
need way to store whether emails are read, flagged, tagged, etc
	use notmuch for all this?
need rules for mailinglist-reply, saving sent email, etc

have cron job
	pulling
	notmuch new
	populate hcache!
have internal and external (to neomutt) versions
	external version reads neomutt config?  expensive?

index: deep option - read emails
	count
	work backwards
	progress meter
	trap ctrl-c
	show date range processed so far

reading repo
	cold/warm fs cache
	cat packfile 13/0s
	git count 6/4s
	git log 10/8s
	1.1GB file
	570K emails

history is linear so
	assign sequence numbers
	factor out newsrc code
