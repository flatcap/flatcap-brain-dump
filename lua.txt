integrate scripting language
	lua, perl, python, ruby

lua as a testing framework: what would I need to expose?
	index functions?
	sidebar functions?
	variables?
	call functions
	macros
	send keystrokes
	get error codes returned from functions

lua initially debug only (for testing)

lua -> travis? / testing
	=> public access to test mailboxes

lua-testing => save_results()
