Separate Address from libemail

- This will require a lot of investigation
- This may not currently be possible, due to dependency problems

The alias code needs to be able to work with addresses.
The address code is currently in libemail.

Can we separate the address code, by moving:
- `address.c`
- `group.c`
- `rfc2047.c`
- `idna.c`

libaddress would be responsible for parsing, storing and serving up addresses.
