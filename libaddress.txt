Address

where from?
loose from alias.rc
straight list Envelope
Branched alias.rc + groups
Tags -> multiple groupings

external list with children
how to display each type?

loose -> list/menu
grouped -> tree
tagged -> sidebar

what are parent-of-group, tag set objects?
	empty addreses?

for tag sidebar need:
	All Addresses
	All Tagged
	Untagged
	Tag1
	Tag2
	...

Tags apply to all children
	e.g. grouped addrs

menu selection: how to tag in multiple groups
pager contains:
	extra info
or
	current selection (cumulative)

sending code shouldn't know about tags/tree structure
addr_lookup(name) -> linearised lst - only if name is unique
OR -> menu of addresses, limited to (name) -- allow unlimiting

sensitive repo for lkml metadata
1) one address per line, raw
2) all raw header address lines
3) all headers (plus a 1 line body)
	need to exclude signing/MIME headers
4) deploy key for travis testing
5) sample addresses with/missing extras
	"comment"
	(comment)
	etc
6) sample addresses with all encodings
7) degenerate addresses
	too long
	etc
8) error codes for all failures
9) sample IDN addresses
