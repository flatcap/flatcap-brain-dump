show messages to user like:
	ChangeLog
	new features
	warnings
	deprecations

Read once, then hidden, but accessible

need persistent variables:
	changelog-2017-09-07-read
	warning-dotlock-read

store them where?
dedicated config file?
	~/.neomutt-messages
	~/.cache/neomutt/messages.rc
	~/.cache/neomutt/binary.db

config that isn't recognised is:
	ignored?
	deleted?

should the config items all be dated?

config that isn't recognised that's
	newer than x months is ignored
	older than x months is delete

where are the messages displayed?
	'magic' virtual mailbox, e.g. "[Messages]"
	others? [Logs] - save mutt_message()
		and read historic files
	[ChangeLog]
	virtual emails have birth and expiry date

source of the files?
	~/.muttdebug*
	/usr/share/doc/neomutt/messages.mbox
		can't mark things as read!
		could save message ids as config var
		msgid_1234ABCD = read
		mimic newsrc (or reuse it)
		implies sequential numbers for all messages

mechanisms for display
	mail -> pager
	summary pages
		implies lots of static files

general user config
	set show_fake_mailbox = yes (default)
	or have a button/binding to change to magic mode
		like virtual mailbox mode
	set visible_mailboxes = local,network,notmuch,info
		+= -= !=
