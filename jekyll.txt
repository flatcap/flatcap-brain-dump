categories for posts: release, news, devel?
	or tags: news, docs
collection of features: both published and devel
footer copyright, gpl, etc
front pager -- latest version, build: travis, coverity, rss
post "short" yaml header => 1 paragraph => no "Read more..."
front page status box : features (16/4) or (16/20)
	no.  status *PAGE*

tidy css
posts sidebar: either list subset of posts centred around current
	or say  <|Prev|3/6|Next|> for context

make the manual sections part of a collection for simplicity?
	easier to theme them, header, footer
