styles: features, dev features, news, releases, site pages

	or tags: news, docs
front pager -- latest version, build: travis, coverity, rss
post "short" yaml header => 1 paragraph => no "Read more..."
front page status box : features (16/4) or (16/20)

jq concertina on feature pages default to all open

prev/next floating bottom-right
sidebars: highlight current page
tidy css
posts sidebar: either list subset of posts centred around current

make the manual sections part of a collection for simplicity?

travis on website? see jekyll-sitemap/travis.yml
features: link (at top) to src, diff against m24
reinstate "Buy Rich a Beer?"  allowed on GitHub?
do I need a mutt-devel branch separate from neomutt?
	probably not -- they're not independent of each other
	sub-branches from neomutt for each task [task/bools]
features: status: stable, warning, devel? (doc this where?)
Goals for neomutt?
