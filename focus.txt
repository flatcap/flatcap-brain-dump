	Window->focus

focus on Pager: focus list is
- Pager
- Index
- Sidebar
- CmdWin
- NeoMutt

PBar, IBar, HelpBar, containers are passive

CmdWin handles ":"!
Sidebar manages its own commands, uses dlg functions to change state
Index controls whether Pager is visible - Next Email, etc
Pager handles 'q', hides self, restores focus to Index
NeoMutt handles 'V' version and other globals
CmdWin: <what-key>

NeoMutt catches ":" unless overridden by the Dialog
	e.g. a backgrounded compose
