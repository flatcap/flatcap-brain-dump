give credit where it's due -- hg author vs committer?
on release
	n commits by m users (p new users)
	list of new
	list of returnees

release criteria
	credits
	changelog
		changes
		num commits?
	clean build
	configure --option (off)
	basic docs
	tidy code (whitespace, etc)
	example config
	screenshots of new features
		text/html screenshots if possible

committer date = author date

reference neomutt repo and neomutt tagline in README

sed s/UNKNOWN/YYYYMMDD/ in PATCHES

separate patch for neomutt (combined)

next neomutt: compress, kdave (skip-quoted (tidied)), bug-fixes (doc)

diagram:	
	features straight line back to mutt
		or put them in a "Key"
	minor --first-parent => list of merges (combine icons) into cartouche
	sidebar 1 merge, no icon => just box (no numbers)
	extra --first-parent -> list of merges (cartouche)
	neomutt (floating branch?) few commits

branches
	neomutt -> latest -- release/neomutt/date = specific
	mutt-kz -> latest -- release/mutt-kz/date = specific

trash folder: forget the directories idea?  who cares about deleted stuff?
trash needs index panel expando -- Original location
archive *needs* dirs %Y / %From?  auto-create, auto-delete on empty
<empty-trash> function
"empty-trash-confirm" variable quad-type
expando for status bar -- trash-size (bytes/Mb) trash-count (number of deleted)
archive needs X-Original-Dir (like del)
	<unarchive> function
tie archive to notmuch to auto index
status bar needs expando for archive contents in (kb,Mb) or (count)
archive/trash expandos -- unless too heavy to calculate
	consult indexes for results/numbers
	does the index store size?
archive needs rich expando save strategy
	%Y, %m, %d -- lots of dates
	%from, %to, etc authors
	%list, $orig-folder
	size/count of attachments
	every conceivable attribute of original mail
use NNTP server (on flatcap.org) to store mentor conversations
	mailing list history too
	topic per mentor idea
	topic for introductions
can nntp compress its mail folders?
	or just compressed disk media underneath
	can mutt-dev-list maintainer get archive from marc.info?
my utf-8 fix to bug-fixes (in fact all my fixes)

make separate commit, fix dates in PATCHES
	version numbers in files
	neo release can't do UNKNOWN -> date
	else all later commits will have that value

[ci skip]
	on all merges into neomutt?
	on release commit (with changelog)?
		no NEED that one for reassurance

only merge at release time (after separate compile tests)
	reduces churn and notifications
	define merge order?

release repo for notes and scripts

pull request to sync changes to mutt-kz
	sidebar
	minors
	bugs

generate checksum

change naming from YYYYMMDD to YYYY-MM-DD?

release notes:
	mention RPMs, etc
