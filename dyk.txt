<grummund>
	Can a folder hook supply the pathname of the mail folder to a shell command it calls out to?
	something like...  folder-hook lists/* 'set from = `script.sh $dir`@example.com'
<kevin8t8>
	you can set an environment variable that you reference from the script.
	folder-hook . 'set visual=^'
	folder-hook . 'setenv MYCURFOLDER $visual'
	this assumes you aren't using $visual for anything, and uses the folder
	shortcut '^' to get the current folder with path variable expansion.
	then assigns it to the envvar of your choice.

msg ranges, relative, ^, $, .

folder-hook =trash             'push <delete-pattern>~d>30d<enter>'
