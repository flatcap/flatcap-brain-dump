distinguish between
	DT_PATH => filesystem path
	DT_MAILBOX => could be virtual
		folder, record, spoolfile, trash
	DT_COMMAND?

types to sort out
	DT_PATH, DT_MAILBOX, DT_COMMAND

flags for expanding:
	1) ~ ($HOME) or ~X (user X's home)
	2) $X (env var)
	3) $x (config var)
	4) relative path
	5) X| (shell expansion)
	6) %x (expando)
	7) `x` (external command)

PATH
	filesystem only
	need to resolve ~/, ~X, $X, $x, relative path
		evaluated when?
		or at all? DON'T PROCESS
	set path var, expand path before use - processes ~
	expand env does $X
	expand config does $x
	expand expando does %x
	what about "xyz|" ?
	one function, 5 flags & sub functions

COMMAND
	similar, don't expand relative, leave it to the shell
	turn args into array/list?
	what's most convenient to:
		a) process args
		b) pass to exec

MAILBOX
	opaque folder name - may be delegated by mailbox to file functions
	mxapi: probe, canon, pretty, equal?, exists?, parent, children
	NEED expansion functions for ^, =/+, etc
	handled by mailbox
	all expanded just-in-time

35 PATH/STRING -> COMMAND
6 MAILBOX folder, record, spoolfile, trash, postponed, mbox
	all account-specific?
