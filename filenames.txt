Logging of filenames/URLs

Applies to:
- mutt_message()
- mutt_warning()
- mutt_error()
- logging to file

Applies to:
- local files/dirs
- clickable URLs


In messages/errors rather than quoting filenames
bright/bold them -- how?
custom printf-specifier?
mutt_message("can't read %Fs");
mutt_message inserts the colour codes if required


logging filenames, have option to highlight them using colour or ANSI link sequences
if using ANSI, optionally abbreviate to just filename
*Always* log full filename
%X (new letter) might upset compiler checks
perhaps use `[%s]` - check for existing (or similar) usage
hmm... still requires rewriting printf,
need to use expando format that only recognises one expando
ANSI marked filenames (or web addresses) don't need escaping
optionally colour ANSI too, for clarity
if ANSI is off, *do* escaping/quoting, automagically
ANSI & (colour/attr) independent of each other
when using URLs, keep proto? e.g. `imap://.../folder`?
option: which protos to abbrev: `file,imap,nntp`
custom optimisations?  nntp://a.s.c.b.b.bork
have separate links when logging?
	Can't copy FILE1. Doesn't exist
	FILE1: /full/file name   (not escaped/quoted)
same for error messages -> multiline (well always 2 lines)
simplifies messages for translation?
