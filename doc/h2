### Requirements

- One source for all docs
- Markdown format
- Easy user contribution

### Plan

- Separate doc repo
  - Markdown files (with hyperlinks)
  - Nested dirs (for sections)
  - YAML header for metadata
  - Accept Issues and Pull Requests

- Website Guide
  - Use GitHub pages (Jeykll)
  - Each page has a button: "Improve this page" (which links to GitHub editor)
  - Use Algolia to search

- Installed Guide
  - Install guide repo
  - Add a new "Help" backend to NeoMutt
  - Use NeoMutt to view/search the guide
  - Use `links` navigation style (arrow keys to select and follow hyperlinks)
  - Each page has a button "Improve this page" (which opens the compose window)

### Benefits
