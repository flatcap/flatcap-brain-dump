Compressed files
	working?
	add to empty box
	add to "add-only" box
	set each combination of hooks

	limitations -- filenames
	document %f %t need to be quoted
		limit filenames
		can't contain quotes
			'' can't contain '
			"" can't contain "
		need code to escape filenames
			would need to be done in an OS-dependent way

hooks should be considered first, then default mutt behaviour
	need test-hook i.e. "is this an xz-compressed" file?
	mailbox type should be per-hook-set

features
	example of tar.gz of maildir mailbox?
	compress won't be able to tidy up
	unless...
		compress creates a dir
		extracts to that dir
		deletes entire dir on close

change hook placeholders to be more descriptive?
%t -> (T)emp file
%p -> (P)laintext file
%c -> (C)ompressed file

docs: mention screen flicker during updates
	=> system commands

tidy open() error paths -- need to delete /tmp files

don't mess with atime of tmp file

compress only opens one file at a time
	should cache decompressed files?
	security? create/delete use close?
		no can't recompress after

CTX ->	COMPRESS ->	REAL
	size		size
	hdrs		hdrs
	ops		ops
	data ->		data ->
	hooks		(fp)
	msg_count	msg_count
	msg_unread	msg_unread
	msg_flagged	msg_flagged

which 'size' is relevant?  INSIDE
	ptrs could redirects
	nums can't

compress
	does it really need: `bool locked`
	or is the `FILE*` enough?

convert compress to use ACL ... can DELETE?

add native compress support
