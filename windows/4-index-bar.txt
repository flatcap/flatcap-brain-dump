Index Bar (status)

N: hostname, version (global)
AL: Unread folders, Postponed msgs
MV: limit, tagged
M: num unread, path

Observes
	N: listen for A,M
	Config for hostname, format str
	MV for limit, etc

Data stored depends on format
Need all data cached =>
	repaint just paints

Flags on data - WHAT'S NEEDED
	MV change => recalc X,Y,Z
	M change => recalc P,Q,R

First run - no cached data
	no flags set
	set flags as each expando processed
	reset if format string changes?

For some data - no cache is required
	just save an object ptr
	use ptr->member

Data - attached to Window
	Flags
	Ptrs (or get_current_X())
	Cached values

Functions
	observers - recalc, set ptrs
	repaint - just gfx
	no handlers - passive

color status ...
	needs to force a repaint of just this window
	start with rule: 'color' => repaint âˆ€
