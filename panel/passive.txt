Passive panels

require data stored on Dialog

- Help
- IndexBar
- PagerBar
- Sidebar (partial)

Help (helpline.c)
	set by index/panel/menu?
	N bind event - who's observing?
	observer set string
	helpline can repaint itself (string is cached)
	doesn't need recalc (will truncate if nec)
	":bind" (could change strng) -> N.notify, observer(N, Helpline, fn)
	Helpline needs enough data to rebuild - menutype, list of options
	special function where weve got nntp, etc
	notify -> recreate string, check if changed, set need-repaint flag
	when dialog closes, set help string to ""
	how does parent dialog know to re*set* helpstring?
	code after every sub-dialog
	OR help has stack of help strings
		(push|set|pop)_help_string
		push(menu, objs)

IndexBar needs M, MV, E, EV attached to dialog
	observe M and Window for "current M"
	"tag" -> MV changed -> need to recalc|paint
	event loop reflows, recalcs, repaints (where nec)

PagerBar needs EV, E attached to dialog
	observe E and Window for "current E"
	"next" -> "current E" changes -> need recalc|paint
	wait for event loop

Dialog needs "current M", "current E", "current A"?
	dlg set(A|M|E) -> notify
	in turn listening to N in case of deletion of object!
