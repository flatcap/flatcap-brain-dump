Fix dependencies of libemail

Upstream recently added a new function to `email/parse.c`: `mutt_auto_subscribe()`.
This requires `url_parse_mailto()` which isn't in the library.

This may be a simple task.

If `url_parse_mailto()` doesn't have any dependencies (except `libmutt`), then move it to `libemail`.

If it does have dependencies, then try to find a way to resolve them :-)
