Text
	The quick brown fox
	jumps over a lazy dog

Drawing options
	enough width, enough height -> two full lines
	normal wrap @char
	normal wrap @work
	flowed wrap @char } - optional end marker
	flowed wrap @work }            start marker/indent
	truncate option

store text as a continuous blob
rope initially split at lines
give rope attributes - header, body, attach?
apply user highlighting (nested)
apply system highlighting -- search, spelling
conceal is a colour, cf vim
each highlighting/end is a metadata insertion
	meta -> static list of attrs

at end of line need to clear all attrs (some will be line-limited)
at start of line need to restart necessary attrs
can we have overlapping (but non-nested) attrs?
	=> break stack model

e.g.
pos     α     β    γ      δ
	apple banana cherry
        |          |      |
        +-----+----+      |
          user colour     |
              |           |
              +-----+-----+
                search colour
α +user colour 6
β +sys colour 4
γ -user colour 6
δ -sys colour 4

need to know how to combine and subtract them
split attrs into component parts: fg, bg, style, alpha?
then decide what to display
some colours will be line-limited, so pop them at EOL

if split mid-banana
+U6 apple
+S4 ba EOL
RESET
+U6 +S4 nana
-U6 cherry
-S4
