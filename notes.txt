possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

gentoo sidebar_format

Sidebar actions (that might precipitate change):
	line-up
	line-down
	page-up
	page-down
	set buffy from browser
	change sort order
	add mailbox

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

tree chars for sidebar hierarchy?
sidebar: how many colours?
CLEARWIN takes a *y* param, not x, likewise sidebar variant

need sensible colour scheme, by default, otherwise highlight won't be visible!
parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

can the real status bar display any sidebar fields?
	why not?
	how can they be integrated?

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
mutt-sidebar.vim (contrib dir?)
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up init.h, globals.h, functions.h
	init.h option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, buffy.c, mh.c
any use from calling sb_init(), sb_shutdown() from main()?
	probably not yet
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
does imap folder add/rm trigger our sb_notify?
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

get rid of REDRAW_SIDEBAR, or use it effectively

can I internalise sb_should_refresh()
often call:
	buffy_mbox_update
	buffy_maildir_update
	mh_buffy_update
what if there are multiple top-levels?
should the LastRefresh var be on the top-level?

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

possible to eliminate sb_get_highlight?
	only called on OP_SIDEBAR_OPEN
	in curs_main.c

move mappings from index/pager -> generic
	in functions.h

only draw divider if
	visibility changes
	width changes
	char changes
	etc
	NO too many variables

any use for ACS_VLINE from curses?
	when do I know it's safe to use?

sidebar expandos
	%c number of non-deleted emails (total - deleted)
	%s = %c? (lower case version of %S?)

add copyright where I've written code

Don't need to actually SORT the BUFFYs, just sort our array
and work from that.  That way SORT_ORDER => unsorted => mailboxes
in their original config order.
Implies we need our own Incoming pointer? or just array[0]?

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info ∀ BUFFYs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

simpler way to generate graphs?
git log --format="h_%h h_%p %D" --branches --simplify-by-decoration

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

sb expandos
	compare letters to status_format letters
	deleted?
	number after limiting
	unread?

notmuch
	add new virtual folders to sidebar
		automatically?
	what name should it be given?
		automatic?
			allow user rename?
		ask user?
	how can we make them persistant?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate BUFFYs
sidebar needs NO-selection possibility for toggle-virtual
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

sb extra colours for:
	readonly mailboxes
		expando?
	bad (non-existent) mailboxes
		expando?
	virtual mailboxes
	what other attrs?
	colour by SRC
	separate colour schemes by SRC?

todo
	integrate nntp into sidebar
	what does notmuch return?
		how do i link it to existing objects?

floating patches/branches
	history -> HEAD
		      \-> neo branch
		      		\-> min build branch

Cedric, VVV, DGC -- check for any utils patches use
	ifdef, nested if, xlabel_ext, purge

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistant undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

look through gmail labs, etc, firefox addons for email plugin ideas

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

all patches --
	PATCHES
	configure
	USE_X
	default configured off

Alternate views in the sidebar
	need toggle function
	imap: folders  <--> dir tree
	local: folders <--> dir browser

	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

data source LDAP

fix copyright dates in all patches

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

cache sidebar formatted strings on BUFFY object?

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

break up and rewrite mutt docs
	break into smaller sections
	separate mutt-doc repo
	translate sections (default to english if missing)

code: switch default must be at end
mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar
dependency graph of all patches
BOOL -> enum?  what about the bitfields?

git
	document git attributes for PATCHES
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

compare conditional builds
	#ifdef
	+/- FEATURE
	configure.ac
	Makefile.am
	compress.c always compiled in?
	nntp.c always compiled in?

regex/regexp pick one in code/docs
	manual.xml

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

Set out notification emails as a nested set:
	Announcement = neomutt description, list of features, links
		Feature X - feature desc, credits, list of files changed, links
		Feature Y - ditto
		Feature Z - ditto
	allowing people to criticise each component individually

docs/muttrc/readme/init.h
	need to document default values for variables

mutt bug - mail isn't from me when it's from
	jimrich@flatcap.org
	bobrich@flatcap.org

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

replace " with ' in muttrc

auto-generate merge commit messages
	modified git log msg
	script for authors
	commented out - but accessible?

git hook variables
	prepare-commit-msg
	GIT_DIR
	GIT_WORK_TREE
	GIT_INDEX_FILE
	GIT_PREFIX
	GITHEAD_XXX

use PATCHES to show bugfixes?
	bugfixes:
		bug1
		bug2
		...
	patch-xxx
	patch-yyy
or
	bugfix1
	bugfix2
	patch-xxx
	patch-yyy

minors - comments for any full functions
	ifdef, index-color, progree, status-color, trash

notmuch - fix dependencies
check minors for () -> (void)

should static functions be called mutt_*?
check minor new functions are static

tidy - check files for leading/trailing whitespace at ends of file
	check for redundant empty lines

cond-date add docs to index_format in init.h
bugs - sidebar - note refresh not really working
community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?
resolve - sort desc, draw status line, open folder
git jump function -- figure out if diff or merge is needed

docs
	add tests.txt
	todo list of ideas

use sort_aux for nested sidebar names?
	no, sub-folders are same type?
		no
	YES: allows to sort by name, then subsort by new-count
	separate variable otherwise it interferes with index, etc

kz issues -- which apply to me?
docs refer to alias menu but don't mention how to invoke it
browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

change docs to use <example>

cond-date needs some concrete examples

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

manual "variables" need description field

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

separate draw() in sidebar for
	emails
	notmuch
	nntp
	addressbook?

sidebar indented folders
	fill in gaps in hierarchy automatically
	make them non-selectable (unless the user has "mailboxes" them)
	alternatively, have some way to mark mailboxes as "fake"
		probably a horrible idea

neomutt motto?
	integrate it first
	decide whether to keep it later
	We accept! (patches)
	If we take your patch, you are responsible for fixing it

BUG: sidebar gives OPEN highlight even if the opening failed
	e.g. bad mailbox

enumerate changes to manual.xml.head
	split up?
	how?

attach sets of keybindings to panel hierarchy?
modify docs generation to process commands' comments
can some keybindings be set "only active when window is visible"?
	=> help doesn't (necessarily) hide sidebar
		should sidebar keys work?  probably not
	*should* help hide the sidebar?
		probably yes

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside are of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

how about modal dialogs?
	1 dialog could invalidate sidebar, index, pager
	sibling to sidebar, index, pager but last in list (z-order)
	sb, index, panel get painted, then "floating" window gets painted over
	modal => disable key mappings/propagation

what does Sidebar *really* need?
	Incoming BUFFY -> notifications of BUFFY changes
	Panel (geometry) -> notifications of WINCH
	character libraries -> lengths, widths, formatting, etc
	options (config access)
	colours
	curses: clear(panel), clear(line), write (char/string), move(x,y)
		curses calls are all (0,0)-based
		curses takes panel object and converts to screen coordinates
		∀ users
	callbacks for functions
	sb is initialised with (Panel pointer), notifications on change
	can query Panel's size, position (not useful), visibility
	panel can be visible, but !active, e.g. partially under a modal dialog
		=> paint if asked, but won't receive keys
		could still be asked to do stuff by dialog, etc

	first, rename variables to be something sensible
	second, refactor to be legible

diagram
	git branch for labels
	git tag for labels
	git log ∀ commits sorting my hash
	stop @ m24
	for each branch/tqag recursively backtrack
	or recursively delete starting at cutoff (m24)
	commits may be older, but they won't be in the past history
	first pass of remainder - first parent only - mark merges
	neomutt special case: cartouche of uniq icons + yellow neo (non-merges)
		=> icons for Sidebar and NotMuch (or capital letters: S, N)
		what about NNTP?  Compress?
	label merges with [M]?

macros() should be MACROS()

gitflow for neomutt branches (and devel)

smime.c:
	variable set to NULL after safe_fclose
	safe_fclose (&smimeout);
	smimeout = NULL;

check everyone's using safe_fopen(), safe_fclose(), etc

rename safe_X(**ptr) to X_null?
	safe_free -> free_null (**ptr)
		-> free_n ()
		-> n_free ()
		-> free_and_null ()

change prototypes for the X_and_NULL macros
	free() doesn't take a double pointer, so
	FREE() shouldn't
	rule of least surprise

try to reduce the scope of all variables
	too many variables are declared at the start of a function
	when they only get used in an if/for/while loop

#define mutt_new_header() safe_calloc (1, sizeof (HEADER))
	et al ought to cast their returns to the correct type

lots of pointers being assiged to 0
	unsigned char *pending_exact = 0;
        should be NULL

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email

save email doesn't respect the umask
vimlocal - check .git dir -- safe from git clean!

on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

mirror script, add copr, aur repos
show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

	.mutt.top-tips ? -- save a list of message-ids in there?
	<top-tips> command creates a new mailbox (from DATA_DIR/DOC_DIR)
		if in /usr it would be read-only
		need to store flags elsewhere
		flags: read, flagged!, deleted (i.e. don't show me again)
	intersperse with mailboxes commands
	tips should be self-contained (to start with)
		unless they reference old tips
		nested emails?  what about multiple inheritance?

doc -> contrib ∀ vimrc, muttrc
	=> will break downstream packaging
	announce change, make change in next release

like noscript in firefox -- "neomutt newly updated message in inbox"
	or :neoversion => "fake email giving changelog"
	or :changelog

2016-08-09
	01:35 <SvenG> but giving a color to "known" addresses (via aliases) would be a killer

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

sidebar "live" search of folders
	key to start searching
	live filtering at every keystroke
	enter selects
	Ctrl-C / Ctrl-G aborts
	fuzzy matching
matching applies to multiple areas of mutt
	sidebar
	aliases

good feature to sell upstream

alternative to sb search

	common docs, travis

1.7.0
	reindent source, split docs => base joiner

wiki link to website

vimrc - each branch maintains its own -- same name, merged in neo
	same problem as docs?  complicated

tip - status_format + status-color
	ctx->readonly => red padlock

compress examples == use full option names

index-color separate colours for "mylocal" and "@domain.com"

notmuch backend: add X-Label in editor, does "right thing" in notmuch?
unified frontend interface (notmuch/keywords) backend
one-direction script -- sync nightmare?
sync notmuch -> X-Label's?  get out of sync

combine all the vimrc's for neomutt

check distrs are installing all docs, contrib, etc

nntp, etc static mx functions

sidebar.h prototype push fix upstream

mvprintw unused?
