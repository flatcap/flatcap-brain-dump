send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
init.h struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal
https://github.com/N8Fear/mutt-kz
	some initialisations improvements
	some bug fixes

sidebar_dividers
	first (wide) character is vertical divider
		between sidebar and index/pager
	second (wide) character is horizontal divider
		between different mailboxes (within the sidebar)

need attention
	draw_sidebar
	OPTSIDEBARSORT
		sorts by real path, not visible name

possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

sidebar_width = auto (size to contents)
	would need to parse and format all strings ahead of drawing divider

sorting
	if displaying full paths:
		sort by display name
		sort by underlying name
	if displaying indented paths:
		sort by top-level names, then children

New only -- include structure (empty dirs) to keep hierarchy
	mail (0)
	  fruit (0)
	    apple (1)

trim trailing slash from mailboxes, folder
	shouldn't be displayed

sb_set_curbuffy
sb_set_buffystats
	should probably both return BOOL on success/failure

sb_draw should return success of drawing
	possible given all the callbacks, etc?

quiet config option -- don't whine about unknown config options
	or quiet command line option

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

DBUS plugin -- to do what?
	notify out
	take input to do what?
		accept mailto: links

repaint if:
	size changes
	position changes

Changed posn notification ONLY
	e.g. sidebar has swapped sides
could imply that cached data may be OK to reuse
	e.g. don't need to call calc_boundaries

Notify (Box*, Rect old, Rect new, flags)
Flags:
	too small to render
	changed visibility

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Sidebar actions (that might precipitate change):
	line-up
	line-down
	page-up
	page-down
	set buffy from browser
	change sort order
	add mailbox
	delete mailbox
	change mailbox's sort criteria (e.g. flag an email, a flagged-sorted mailbox)
	resize window
	hide sidebar
	show sidebar
	open folder

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

draw sidebar
	assumes position/size
	move due to STATUSONTOP, HELP
	check of show/hidden has changed & refresh numbers if nec
	if hidden, do nothing
	sanity check settings
	draw divider (3 chars!)
for all buffers
	set colour
	move
	gen displayname (need to cache this)
		name, bytelen, screenlen
		what about config changes
			including sort order
	make sidebar_entry
fill remaining lines with blanks

Start; Incoming; Inbox open; current = Incoming; sort → cur is offscreen, boundaries lost

tree chars for sidebar hierarchy?

parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

can the real status bar display any sidebar fields?
	why not?
	how can they be integrated?

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up init.h, globals.h, functions.h
	init.h option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, buffy.c, mh.c
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

sidebar expandos
	%c number of non-deleted emails (total - deleted)
	%s = %c? (lower case version of %S?)

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info ∀ BUFFYs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

sb expandos
	compare letters to status_format letters
	deleted?
	number after limiting
	unread?

notmuch
	add new virtual folders to sidebar
		automatically?
	what name should it be given?
		automatic?
			allow user rename?
		ask user?
	how can we make them persistant?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate BUFFYs
sidebar needs NO-selection possibility for toggle-virtual
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

sb extra colours for:
	readonly mailboxes
		expando?
	bad (non-existent) mailboxes
		expando?
	virtual mailboxes
	what other attrs?
	colour by SRC
	separate colour schemes by SRC?

integrate nntp into sidebar
what does notmuch return?
	how do i link it to existing objects?

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistant undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

Alternate views in the sidebar
	need toggle function
	imap: folders  <--> dir tree
	local: folders <--> dir browser

	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

data source LDAP

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares
	gperf to generate perfect hashes

cache sidebar formatted strings on BUFFY object?

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

break up and rewrite mutt docs
	break into smaller sections
	separate mutt-doc repo
	translate sections (default to english if missing)

mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar

git
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

docs/muttrc/readme/init.h
	need to document default values for variables

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

replace " with ' in muttrc

auto-generate merge commit messages
	modified git log msg
	script for authors
	commented out - but accessible?

git hook variables
	prepare-commit-msg
	GIT_DIR
	GIT_WORK_TREE
	GIT_INDEX_FILE
	GIT_PREFIX
	GITHEAD_XXX

community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?

use sort_aux for nested sidebar names?
	no, sub-folders are same type?
		no
	YES: allows to sort by name, then subsort by new-count
	separate variable otherwise it interferes with index, etc

docs refer to alias menu but don't mention how to invoke it
browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

change docs to use <example>

cond-date needs some concrete examples

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

manual "variables" need description field

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

separate draw() in sidebar for
	emails
	notmuch
	nntp
	addressbook?

sidebar indented folders
	fill in gaps in hierarchy automatically
	make them non-selectable (unless the user has "mailboxes" them)
	alternatively, have some way to mark mailboxes as "fake"
		probably a horrible idea

attach sets of keybindings to panel hierarchy?
modify docs generation to process commands' comments
can some keybindings be set "only active when window is visible"?
	=> help doesn't (necessarily) hide sidebar
		should sidebar keys work?  probably not
	*should* help hide the sidebar?
		probably yes

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside area of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

how about modal dialogs?
	1 dialog could invalidate sidebar, index, pager
	sibling to sidebar, index, pager but last in list (z-order)
	sb, index, panel get painted, then "floating" window gets painted over
	modal => disable key mappings/propagation

what does Sidebar *really* need?
	Incoming BUFFY -> notifications of BUFFY changes
	Panel (geometry) -> notifications of WINCH
	character libraries -> lengths, widths, formatting, etc
	options (config access)
	colours
	curses: clear(panel), clear(line), write (char/string), move(x,y)
		curses calls are all (0,0)-based
		curses takes panel object and converts to screen coordinates
		∀ users
	callbacks for functions
	sb is initialised with (Panel pointer), notifications on change
	can query Panel's size, position (not useful), visibility
	panel can be visible, but !active, e.g. partially under a modal dialog
		=> paint if asked, but won't receive keys
		could still be asked to do stuff by dialog, etc

kill version.c:rstrip_in_place()
	fix external build scripts

vim library of config options(vars)
	auto-extract from init.h

rewrite mutt_wstr_trunc()
	first, rename variables to be something sensible
	second, refactor to be legible

kdave - limit-current-thread
	alt-l (show limit) should respond "limit thread"
	is "limit ." the same as "limit all" -- YES
		fixed internally
	create unlimit patch and pull-request for kdave?
	limit doesn't have any context, just a pattern
	limit-current-thread NEEDS to know current email
	it'd be nice to change limit to accept another "string" arg
	currently
		"all" -> "~A"
	change limit
		"thread" -> "~a" (only letter available)
		let general limit machinery do the work
	unfortunately they can't see the current email

save email doesn't respect the umask

integrate patchlist into new version of ifdef checking
doc travis and coverity options
missing qdbm, slang-dev
split source?
	tools/ - standalone exes
	library/ - replacement library functions
	readme/ - obvious

fmemopen - merge into one place in mutt_mktemp()?
	idea from dgc email
rebase and refactor [devel/*] before moving to [feature/*]
	factor this description into new-feature txt
sidebar, when saving email to a folder use the sidebar as a selector?
	new indicator colour or prompts "select save folder" + normal highlight
join mutt-users and ask both lists what patches/version they're using
	send me your "mutt -v"
	any security risk to this information?
	OS info useful too
Do drafts *need* to be stored in a separate folder?
	why not inline?
	in threaded order
	just tagged or coloured
	status flag to denote draft
email David Sterba (kdave) -- limit
	use context, or change prototypes

<sidebar-next-new> => $sidebar_flagged_are_new ?

panels have dividers enum
	left
	right
	top
	bottom
	between
	outside
who owns the dividers space?
set_focus (panel)
	who owns the focus?
	gfx(curses)?
	get_char -> gfx_get_char -> consider focus
on close panel, focus moves to
	*prev*/next sibling, or parent?
	due to mutt's UI focus moves to prev sibling
how can I show focus without moving anything? i.e. borders
	sacrifice a top line?
	border highlight?  => always present
which panels *accept* focus?
	sidebar
	index window
	pager window
	<tab> to switch?
	or <left>, <right>?

mirror script, add copr, aur repos
show focus -- sacrifice help line?
	no, it's not always visible
propagation of notifications -- start @focus, work down
	SB, IW, PW + 'q' mail accepts, hides PW, PS, focus IW
	SB, IW + 'q' mail notified, rejects, global accepts, closes app
Help starts @focus, Panel Name + get_keys method
if sidebar is a separate panel and src file, should IW be?  PW?  AI?
If focus is on PW and SB, IW, PW are siblings, how can SB get notifications?
	or does mail Panel catch and iterate through children?
	SB mappings are (index,pager) => behaviour wanted but not in AW

delegation of keys -> focus() -> parent -> global, e.g. IW, Mail
	functions => components (e.g. mail)	}- mail_init() register_functions(); register_commands();
	commands => components			}

2016-08-09
	01:35 <SvenG> but giving a color to "known" addresses (via aliases) would be a killer

2016-08-12
	08:31 <flip214> Hi. Another thing I would love to see: an email arrives in INBOX; I answer it,
		and define the FCC for the sent mail, but the incoming mail is still in INBOX.
		so a "reply-and-move-to-same-folder" would be interesting to me.

sidebar "live" search of folders

	it would be very nice if switching to an imap folder could be aborted by ctrl-c

mutt IPA /mʌt/

newbie - recommend setting 'set user_agent = yes'

update vim-syntax

create list of current scripts shell/perl
	build processors
	automators
	list -> website -- link to repos
	#!/bin/bash ->  sh

branch 123-desc auto work-in-progress

issue - auto screenshots - sample mailbox

commands
	rename all those containing _ (underscore) to - (hyphen)
	accept either
	autocomplete to hyphen
	linter for muttrc -- with warnings

limit current thread
	new mail shows up even when not in thread

turn off status bar, like vim laststatus

limit-to-tag function?

mutt -D? (extra options)
	turn output into valid muttrc
	validate muttrc without running
	only display CHANGED values
	only hide SET values
	SORT the options
	add comments from init.h?
	show default values/keybindings

can I (neomutt) sign the copr key?

type:investigate ?
	something that needs research
	might lead to docs
	might not lead to code

investigate
	EXACT_ADDRESS
	where did it come from?
	why is it there?
	do we still need it?

trash folder: forget the directories idea?	who cares about deleted stuff?
trash needs index panel expando -- Original location
archive *needs* dirs %Y / %From?  auto-create, auto-delete on empty
<empty-trash> function
"empty-trash-confirm" variable quad-type
expando for status bar -- trash-size (bytes/Mb) trash-count (number of deleted)
archive needs X-Original-Dir (like del)
	<unarchive> function
tie archive to notmuch to auto index
status bar needs expando for archive contents in (kb,Mb) or (count)
archive/trash expandos -- unless too heavy to calculate
	consult indexes for results/numbers
	does the index store size?
archive needs rich expando save strategy
	%Y, %m, %d -- lots of dates
	%from, %to, etc authors
	%list, $orig-folder
	size/count of attachments
	every conceivable attribute of original mail
use NNTP server (on flatcap.org) to store mentor conversations
	mailing list history too
	topic per mentor idea
	topic for introductions
can nntp compress its mail folders?
	or just compressed disk media underneath
	can mutt-dev-list maintainer get archive from marc.info?

release criteria for a new feature
	changelog
		changes
		num commits?
	clean build
	configure --option (off)
	basic docs
	tidy code (whitespace, etc)
	example config
	screenshots of new features
		text/html screenshots if possible

git map
	read config for default remote

mailbox +/wibble
mailbox =wibble
	aren't equivalent, caused problems for squillis on irc 2017-02-10
	# mailboxes =INBOX "+/Drafts" "+/Sent Items" "+/Systems/A" "+/Systems/B" "+/Systems/C"

notmuch:
	nm_get_all_tags() is called twice (once to count, then once to build the list)

safe macros enhancement request: https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/issues/69#issuecomment-230442101
	zmo suggests: emulate the augroup feature of vim :)
	macros specific to a folder, or notmuch, etc
	have an "account" function that limits to one account
	account "imap://..." set sidebar_visible = yes

script fuzzy / translation checker
	compare %-count syntax
	1300*30 ~ 40K compressed!

web misc contrib page <h1> per item

po multi-fold comment, english, foreign -- why bother?

can't find mailbox ops error mesage -- coder only compress.c

./configure --help what's enabled by default?  *clearer*

debian devs are any platforms NOT using gcc/clang?
	do they have FILE, LINE, FUNC?

categorise all messages in code
	info, warning, error, question
which imply user to do: nothing, be informed, worry, query user
errors should be clear whose fault
user: e.g. type something invalid
config: file invalid / missing
code: internal error, missing ops
separate what user cannot do vs MAY not doc

functions.h attach-news-messages #ifdef NNTP!
"source" command relative to $cwd or previous file

pre-reply hook -- takes original email and formats it however
or
pre-sent hook, filter before send?
why bother?  should be done in editor?

nntp on MY server - 3 groups
	user ml
	devel ml
	github issues
what about:
	mutt user ml
	mutt dev ml

find markdown code theme that I like

review describe with pictures the three github merge options

tagged initialisers -> coding standard
variable length arrays -> are they safe?

check nntp for updates
muttrc linter corrent, or comment out?
base64 3 byte work chunks -- bigger?

mutt google map of devs
	lettered for maintainers
	dot for others?

merging explain to newbies about squashing

flowchart for sending an email, showing:
	screens,
	<functions>
	hooks
	include signing
	postpone
	screenshots (text)

squash or not - consider need to revert 1 piece
~Y docs match label missing?

pager colour filter start/stop regex + lua script?
what does it insert?  or does it call back to get mutt to highlight?
script is stateful

irc notes: assume humour before anger/offence

conceallevel (for pager/index)
	0 off
	1 conceal
	2 conceal and squash
for index, 1 list "there are 'n' concealed threads"

link to OS *guide*

filter to turn :+1: into emoji character

issues: shooting for zero
	try to get down to zero issues/PRs
	what about long discussions?
		close them
			two weeks after last comment
			four?
	what about unlikely enhancement requests
		doc on website (with links)
		close them

guyzmo's merge/review notes

doc how to become a reviewer

example notes for a PR
	don't walk away
	you need to work with us to get it merged
example notes for an issue
	need to be around to help us find the problem
	might need to test the solution

readme shorten to just maintainers?
	link to full list of authors

imap flags summary

Releases
	comments = docs
	translations too - in either release

all PRs to in-progress?

issues for upstream sync - share the lot

save backlog of messages in a deleted file!

work towards: no commit without an issue
	A reviewer's "OK" for an idea can come from:
		issue
		IRC
		mailing list

github peer review bot:
	https://github.com/felixrieseberg/peer-review-bot

reorganise docs
	migrate them all to docbook (or markdown?)
		if markdown, how good will the html look?
		what about conditional docs?
			how do we only include that which we compile?
			too hard?
			WHICH sections are currently conditional?
	generate man pages from these sources
	strip init.h of its docs
	get default values from "mutt -D" instead

github/irc bot.  notify on:
	@neomutt/reviewers Please Review -> "guyzmo asked for review of #298 (Desc)"
	"flatcap approved #298 (Desc)"

test all the sample muttrc files -- check there aren't any old commands/variables

account object that lives above BUFFYs
	emails
		maildir
		mbox
		imap
		pop
	notmuch
	nntp
can be visible or hidden

investigate:
	global config
	list all the IMAP variables
	list all their uses

lua styling/colour callback
	c functions: hprintf(), push_attr(), pop_attr()
	shared definitions: C_FG_RED, C_FG_BLUE, A_UNDERLINE, A_REVERSE, etc

	c	lua_style_line(HANDLE, DATA[])
	lua	hprintf(HANDLE, "hello ")
		push_attr(HANDLE, C_FG_RED)
		push_attr(HANDLE, A_REVERSE)
		hprintf(HANDLE, "world")
		pop_attr(HANDLE)
		pop_attr(HANDLE)

move the guide to readthedocs.org?

.gitattributes
	ignore changes to .travis.yml
	from merging branches
	hmm... but it'll be in all branches
	does this make sense?

bot command
	/notice botty doc $folder
		privately messages botty
	botty replies in-channel

script to follow all the projects members

add template email for newbies getting credit

api
	functions to query aliases

webpage: new status
	wip-help -- "Work in progress - Please help (instructions)

po
	don't need line numbers for git
	might need them for poeditor

create muttrc that undoes everything that might be in /etc/Muttrc

useful: extract_url.pl

when saving a file (being asked for input),
	add a mechanism to expand a mutt variable
	like vim's ^R

release
	post comment to aur package

2017-03-06 #mutt
	17:40 <parosen> "set -o vi" functionality in mutt?

sidebar intro
	priority of colours may be wrong after upstream changes
	https://www.neomutt.org/feature/sidebar-intro#intro-sidebar-colors

botty
	look for commits?
	a7b0fb8
	https://github.com/neomutt/neomutt/commit/a7b0fb8
	<p class="commit-title">Clear out extraneous errors before SSL_connect() (see #3916)</p>

convert the bug-fixes section of the travis build.sh to work on the upstream branch
	(test all commits, with a small spread of configs)

change "L10N" comments to "TRANSLATORS:"
	(as that's the default)

mutt marks -- are they mailbox-local?
	can we distinguish (like vim) betweeen
	`a  mark in this index
	`A  global mark (potentially in another mailbox)
		is it safe to change mailboxes without warning?
		I suppose macros do this

(mutt_)dotlock.c why both?
smime_keys(.pl) why both?

web guide update docs for toogley

move muttrc* vimrc* to contrib/

sync web & contrib versions of hcache benchmarks
	how?

topics for my github repos, icons?

code: reserved words: new, this, etc

jekyll page type "hidden" -- don't list

coding standard: two copies
	part 1:
		full descriptions
		examples
		anchors <a name="">
	part 2:
		auto-generated (script or jekyll)
		concise list + links to full examples
alternative, have coding standard in _std dir
	pieced together by jekyll for both versions

docs todo
	contribution
	first feature
	release
		scripts etc
	style (code)
	irc welcome text

enable debug from within mutt
	set debuglevel
	set debugfile
	rotate files?

configure.ac broken for conditional features
	--enable-lua
	no libraries
	shows "lua: yes"
	compiles with "-USE_LUA"
same problem for all the options that are conditional-but-need-libraries
test options
	enable-lua/disable-lua/enable-everything/unspecified
	lua libs/no lua libs

"approved" tag? when an idea under discussion gets the go-ahead?
	or just remove the "discussion" tag?

configure summary?
	--disable-docs -> docs:         no
	--disable-po   -> translations: no

web toplevel dir
	/muttrc
	move all samples from the guide
	link guide to samples

configure summary
	Libs:              -lanl -lncursesw -lnotmuch 
	Mutt libs:          -lncursesw -ltokyocabinet -lkyotocabinet -lgdbm -lqdbm -ldb-5.3 -llmdb -lidn 
what's the distinction?  notmuch and lmdb are both user-specified external deps

fail configure if *wide* curses is missing?

2017-03-22 #mutt
	14:43 <wayne47> is there a way to specify a unique SMTP server per mail box?
	14:44 <wayne47> so that when I read mail via imap from foo.com, outgoing mail uses foo.com and when I read from bar.com, outgoing mail uses bar.com (etc)?

all example muttrcs
	bring them up-to-date (valid options)
	or delete them

warn on option synonym usage
	{ "pgp_autoencrypt",		DT_SYN,  R_NONE, UL "crypt_autoencrypt", 0 },
	{ "crypt_autoencrypt",	DT_BOOL, R_NONE, OPTCRYPTAUTOENCRYPT, 0 },
	crypt_autoencrypt is the visible option
	warn if pgp_autoencrypt is used

doc build requirement on DocBook DTDs

ask people how often they'd like to be chased up

merge muttrc.feature* into one file
	leave markers in that are converted to <a name> anchors
	so we can easily link to sections

macro REGEXEC is only used once

create doc repo
	have neomutt repo as a "fixed" git submodule
	or a submodule of a doc-gen repo

branches in neomutt repo may be eligible for a free rebase
	develop in your own repo, and they may not

use *mutt* to generate sample mailboxes
	create folders
	create emails
	etc

update mutt releases web page

coverity -- some code untested due to config options, e.g. openssl
	need coverage test

double-width index (continuation of first for wide screens)
	| side | index1 | index2 |

drop notmuch checks -- assume newer version?

write REQUIREMENTS doc
	C99
	SUS (Single Unix Specification)
	NotMuch >= 4.3.0
	etc

change #ifndef's to #warning too
	#ifndef SYMBOL
	#define SYMBOL
	#warning "Please tell neomutt devs about this
	#endif
