#defines → enums?

make AUTHORS -- which repo did this?

Ultrix dead '95
	ask debian devs for list of working arches

init all vars
lots of static fns → _fn_name?
^L in source
Doxygen comments

Vim-style
	:set     → show all modified vars
	:set all → all all vars
	:unset === set novar

strict compilation flags; c++ compiler?
unnamed args in function prototypes
spurious \ line endings (in middle of if!)

	new/deleted
	new mail, deleted mail, flagged mail, etc
connection status
	connected

possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

gentoo sidebar_format
	set sidebar_format="%B %* %S%?N?(%N)?%?F?[%F]?"

Sidebar actions (that might precipitate change):
	line-up
	line-down
	page-up
	page-down
	set buffy from browser
	change sort order
	add mailbox

tree chars for sidebar hierarchy?
sidebar: how many colours?
CLEARWIN takes a *y* param, not x, likewise sidebar variant

need sensible colour scheme, by default, otherwise highlight won't be visible!
parse_mailboxes -> notify sidebar => know if anything's invalidated TBCH
can I use realpath(), mutt_expand_path() for anything?

Unmailbox * ⇒  many notifications followed by ONE redraw

can the real status bar display any sidebar fields?
	why not?
	how can they be integrated?

most options are "short" limited to +/- 32767
mutt-sidebar.vim (contrib dir?)
set/unset/toggle?  invVARNAME
option - don't sort inbox -- defined how?
separate modules -- sidebar, index, pager, help? -- each with
	init()
	notify()
	close()
	config()
sidebar_wrap=search,motion (separate bools for simplicity?)

sidebar_sort is an enum - on set error, it could show the valid values
quadopt can give help too -- important since varname gives no clue about type
break up init.h, globals.h, functions.h
	init.h option DELEGATE, prefix "sidebar_", callback?
init() on module calls add_options()
	=> sb_opts refer to sb-private vars in sidebar.c
option breakup depends on lots of notifications
Where are OPTSIDEBAR* used outside sidebar.c
	curs_main.c, buffy.c, mh.c
any use from calling sb_init(), sb_shutdown() from main()?
	probably not yet
TEST: deleting/adding entries on/off-screen
	are our indexes correctly maintained?
TEST: refresh limit -- changing vars from another mutt
TEST: (re-)sorting by changing sort criteria from another mutt
Distinguish between movement and search wrap?
	movement - next/prev (1 line), page up/down
	search - find next/prev new
Readme.sidebar, Changelog.sidebar?
does imap folder add/rm trigger our sb_notify?
Config change notifications
	fn (name, old_val, new_val)
how would function delegation work?
	init() -> add_functions (name, callback)
	the callbacks would need to be able to manipulate mutt objects
Register functions & callback
make sure anything we need is exposed
if we hide our globals, give then all accessor functions get/set_VAR()
init would need to register new sort methods

get rid of REDRAW_SIDEBAR, or use it effectively

test conditional compilation
	pop imap sidebar slang gpgme debug
	smime pgp nls iconv hcache smtp
	ssl gss idn
without
	gdbm qdbm tokyocabinet wc-funcs

can I internalise sb_should_refresh()
often call:
	buffy_mbox_update
	buffy_maildir_update
	mh_buffy_update
what if there are multiple top-levels?
should the LastRefresh var be on the top-level?

demo setup - lots of files in:
	local mbox
	local mh dirs
	IMAP mbox
	IMAP mh dirs
	POP mbox
	POP mh dirs

possible to eliminate sb_get_highlight?
	only called on OP_SIDEBAR_OPEN
	in curs_main.c

move mappings from index/pager -> generic
	in functions.h

tests:
	set all config options to: valid, invalid, empty
	both in muttrc and within mutt

only draw divider if
	visibility changes
	width changes
	char changes
	etc
	NO too many variables

any use for ACS_VLINE from curses?
	when do I know it's safe to use?

sidebar expandos
	%c number of non-deleted emails (total - deleted)
	%s = %c? (lower case version of %S?)

add copyright where I've written code

Don't need to actually SORT the BUFFYs, just sort our array
and work from that.  That way SORT_ORDER => unsorted => mailboxes
in their original config order.
Implies we need our own Incoming pointer? or just array[0]?

alternative to lightweight patch
	don't update info ∀ BUFFYs
	just update the current page
	only update lists when the user OPENs a folder
	not when they move the highlight
	could pre-emptively populate the previous/next pages

simpler way to generate graphs?
git log --format="h_%h h_%p %D" --branches --simplify-by-decoration

postpone patch doesn't quite work
	1) The PostContext and menu are private, so sidebar can't tell that
	   we're looking at the postponed list after navigation.
	2) After navigating to another folder, you still have to "quit" to
	   get the display to refresh.

sb expandos
	compare letters to status_format letters
	deleted?
	number after limiting
	unread?

notmuch
	add new virtual folders to sidebar
		automatically?
	what name should it be given?
		automatic?
			allow user rename?
		ask user?
	how can we make them persistant?

Where does getchar() get called?  can I centralise them?
Does getchar() wait or poll?  Need it to poll
Polling -> Idle -> Event callback that I can use to populate BUFFYs
sidebar needs NO-selection possibility for toggle-virtual
need to clear index on Toggle-Virtual

sb extra colours for:
	readonly mailboxes
		expando?
	bad (non-existent) mailboxes
		expando?
	virtual mailboxes
	what other attrs?
	colour by SRC
	separate colour schemes by SRC?

todo
	merge kz and new sidebar
	integrate nntp into sidebar
	find & merge trash-dir patches
	what does notmuch return?
		how do i link it to existing objects?
	kz unmailbox bugfix: needed?
		mutt_buffy_check(0) at end of parse_virtual_mailboxes

add kz's version suffix to add "-neo"
floating patches/branches
	history -> HEAD
		      \-> neo branch
		      		\-> min build branch
neo branch contains
	version fix

Cedric, VVV, DGC -- check for any utils patches use
	ifdef, nested if, xlabel_ext, purge

Undo, what's possible?
	Last action?
	Many actions?
persistant undo on email editing?
undelete?
unsend?
tagging?

look through gmail labs, etc, firefox addons for eamil plugin ideas

signature manager
disposable email address plugin?
	need external API to send/receive

all patches --
	PATCHES
	configure
	USE_X
	default configured off

Alternate views in the sidebar
	need toggle function
	imap: folders  <--> dir tree
	local: folders <--> dir browser

	address book? -- different grouping/hierarchy?
	calendar? -- different timescales?
	news?  subscribed   <--> all groups
	rss?   unread feeds <--> all feeds

data source LDAP

fix copyright dates in all patches

which config items require frequent and costly interpretation?
	all format strings -- every line, every refresh

keep revision number for all config items (as a prelude to proper notifications)
	only increment revision number on change
	leads to possible A-B-A problem (change blindness)
	if (ver(format_str) > old_ver) STMT;
	allows code to make informed decisions about caching

cache for formatted strings?
	too much can change
		index: flags, folded-ness
		sidebar: all numbers => cache invalid

index format -- full directory mode
	show unix perms like ls
	user/group/etc
	too specific?
	what about other OSs?

refer to and compare config names by hash only?
	save lots of string compares

cache sidebar formatted strings on BUFFY object?

what are the objects in the Index?
	cache the index formatted strings on them

introduce new format strings
	index_rich_format

break up and rewrite mutt docs
	break into smaller sections
	separate mutt-doc repo
	translate sections (default to english if missing)

code: switch default must be at end
mutt folder/dir browser
	".."/open should start with current folder/dir selected
	display full path at top of screen/statusbar/titlebar
dependency graph of all patches
BOOL -> enum?  what about the bitfields?

git
	document git attributes for PATCHES
	create git diff regex for manual.xml to identify the section where the changes occurred
		grep "<sect[0-9] " manual.xml.head 
		need to look for <sect> <chapter> <table> <example>
	check the default 'c' git diff regex against sidebar.c
		check C function
		check C struct/enum

Do I want a dev branch of 'fixes' before bug-fixes branch?
	.gitignore, what else?
kzak branch - stuff I don't want in neo patch
	versions stuff, .gitignore, build stuff

compare conditional builds
	#ifdef
	+/- FEATURE
	configure.ac
	Makefile.am
	compress.c always compiled in?

regex/regexp pick one in code/docs
	manual.xml
		regexp 65
		regex 7
	*.[ch]

Generated muttrc is an encyclopaedia
Supplied  muttrc is a guide for dummies

Set out notification emails as a nested set:
	Announcement = neomutt description, list of features, links
		Feature X - feature desc, credits, list of files changed, links
		Feature Y - ditto
		Feature Z - ditto
	allowing people to criticise each component individually

docs/muttrc/readme/init.h
	need to document default values for variables

mutt bug - mail isn't from me when it's from
	jimrich@flatcap.org
	bobrich@flatcap.org

index_color should apply to status_bar when viewing mail
status_color should apply to mid-status_bar when (pager_index_lines > 0)
shouldn't be affected by 'status_on_top' either

cond-date
	all,dates,are,broken@ 1y -> this year (not 12 months)
		1w -> this week (not 7 days)
		if the dates were sensible (7d = 7 days back from now)
		they'd tie in with ~d, e.g.
			color index color237 default "~d>30d"         # Over a month old
		reuse the ~d code
			pattern.c:eat_date()

replace " with ' in muttrc

check tidiness of newly added sidebar code

save merge commit messages (for features)
auto-generate merge commit messages
	modified git log msg
	script for authors
	commented out - but accessible?

git hook variables
	prepare-commit-msg
	GIT_DIR
	GIT_WORK_TREE
	GIT_INDEX_FILE
	GIT_PREFIX
	GITHEAD_XXX

use PATCHES to show bugfixes?
	bugfixes:
		bug1
		bug2
		...
	patch-xxx
	patch-yyy
or
	bugfix1
	bugfix2
	patch-xxx
	patch-yyy

check if any of the bug-fixes are already in default

minors - comments for any full functions
	ifdef, index-color, progree, status-color, trash

notmuch - fix dependencies
check minors for () -> (void)

should static functions be called mutt_*?
check minor new functions are static
bugs - sidebar unsorted isn't -- add to docs

tidy - check files for leading/trailing whitespace at ends of file
	check for redundant empty lines

cond-date add docs to index_format in init.h
bugs - sidebar - note refresh not really working
community script check for update
	date community docs?
	or just rely on commit date?
resolve - sort desc, draw status line, open folder
git jump function -- figure out if diff or merge is needed

docs
	add tests.txt
	todo list of ideas

use sort_aux for nested sidebar names?
	no, sub-folders are same type?
		no
	YES: allows to sort by name, then subsort by new-count
	separate variable otherwise it interferes with index, etc

kz issues -- which apply to me?
docs refer to alias menu but don't mention how to invoke it
browser
	can sort my num new msg, but can't display count itself
	sort needs docs -> promote to feature?
		check kz for docs/examples
	%n isn't representative of "all message count"
		doc as (N)umber of messages, or
		%c message (C)ount

do format conditional work on strings, etc?  meaningful?
	empty => false

each feature needs to add NeoMutt xml & README
check all xml anchor names

compress
	limitations -- filenames
	document %f %t need to be quoted
		limit filenames
		can't contain quotes
			'' can't contain '
			"" can't contain "
		need code to escape filenames
			would need to be done in an OS-dependent way

compose sidebar changelog
	abridged

compress -- hooks should be considered first, then default mutt behaviour
	need test-hook i.e. "is this an xz-compressed" file?
	mailbox type should be per-hook-set

change docs to use <example>

cond-date needs some concrete examples

source command -- allow wildcards
	fits in nicely with ifndef
	or 'source_dir' command to read all contents
	or "source dir" to read all contents
	recursive option?
	recursive by default?

manual "variables" need description field

'c' fails if dir has trailing /
	e.g. when you use <tab> to complete!
'c' to open fails, test cmdline open too
	check sidebar displays correct highlight/open

changes to css must set both fg, bg
	cf <note>
	reduce colour of <command>s too

separate draw() in sidebar for
	emails
	notmuch
	nntp
	addressbook?

sidebar indented folders
	fill in gaps in hierarchy automatically
	make them non-selectable (unless the user has "mailboxes" them)
	alternatively, have some way to mark mailboxes as "fake"
		probably a horrible idea

neomutt motto?
	integrate it first
	decide whether to keep it later
	We accept! (patches)

BUG: sidebar gives OPEN highlight even if the opening failed
	e.g. bad mailbox

mutt-patches is mine
	integrate into all patches
	css etc?

enumerate changes to manual.xml.head
	split up?
	how?

move mutt-patches to bug fixes

css NEEDED for sidebar

attach sets of keybindings to panel hierarchy?
modify docs generation to process commands' comments
can some keybindings be set "only active when window is visible"?
	=> help doesn't (necessarily) hide sidebar
		should sidebar keys work?  probably not
	*should* help hide the sidebar?
		probably yes

CENTERLINE is unused
PAGELEN is used in ONE place

how should mutt_yesorno() work?
	Question is asked modally & outside are of asker
	=> hide command line, show question
	question panel gets request, shows itself, hides command
		make command-line panel invisible?
		make question panel higher in z-order?
			=> they are coincident

how about modal dialogs?
	1 dialog could invalidate sidebar, index, pager
	sibling to sidebar, index, pager but last in list (z-order)
	sb, index, panel get painted, then "floating" window gets painted over
	modal => disable key mappings/propagation

what does Sidebar *really* need?
	Incoming BUFFY -> notifications of BUFFY changes
	Panel (geometry) -> notifications of WINCH
	character libraries -> lengths, widths, formatting, etc
	options (config access)
	colours
	curses: clear(panel), clear(line), write (char/string), move(x,y)
		curses calls are all (0,0)-based
		curses takes panel object and converts to screen coordinates
		∀ users
	callbacks for functions
	sb is initialised with (Panel pointer), notifications on change
	can query Panel's size, position (not useful), visibility
	panel can be visible, but !active, e.g. partially under a modal dialog
		=> paint if asked, but won't receive keys
		could still be asked to do stuff by dialog, etc
