Mutt panel manager

start with whole window (80x24)
Carve off blocks in sequence
Carve up by rows/cols or %age
All moves/prints now use opaque handles to the panel
Moves/prints strictly limited to panel
functions on panel
	get_rect
	clear_to_bol
	clear_to_eol
	clear_to_top
	clear_to_bottom
	clear_panel
Panels could wrap/nowrap
	handle left/right scrolling
	could be view_panes -- all data passed
		the panel controls paging
			too slow?
	needs to be paged by the panel user
controls to move between panels
	invisible cursor -- so left, right returns to where you were, etc
	mnemonics too?
	show focus with
		terminal's cursor?
		colour?
	
Example carving set:
	Block	Size	Name		X	Y	W	H	Notes
	top	1 line	Menu		0	0	80	1
	top	1 line	Help		0	1	80	1
	bottom	1 line	Entry		0	23	80	1
	bottom	1 line	Status		0	22	80	1
	left	20 cols	Sidebar		0	2	20	20	on by default
	right	0 cols	Reply		80	2	0	20	off by default
	top	10 line	Pager		20	2	60	10	currently on
	rest	-	Message		20	12	60	20	currently on

Hide pager ->
	signal pager (hidden)
	signal message (resize, rect)

Hide sidebar ->
	signal sidebar (hidden)
	signal pager (resize, rect)
	signal message (resize, rect)

Close message ->
	signal message (hidden)
	signal pager (resize, rect)

Carve param: can receive focus
Where does the help page fit in?
	which panels does it hide?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notifications

Window changes
	hidden	no params
	visible	rect
	resize	rect
	focus	in/out
colours changes
keypress	key, no params
config change	key, value
		ALL, no params
mail status change
	read/unread/flagged/deleted/edited
	MESSAGE_ID, flags
mailbox change
	new/deleted
	new mail, deleted mail, flagged mail, etc
connection status
	connected
	disconnected
quitting - any use to anyone?
selected mail changed
selected mailbox changed

Panel manager - where does the horizontal divider fit in?
	status bar between pager and message
Panels can have vertical and/or horizontal scrollbars
	1 line/col  |----######-----------|
wrapping ->
	extra char at beginning of line "+"
	extra char at end of line "<-/"
wrap at:
	char
	word (whitespace)
	clause (punctuation)
	sentence (.!?)
No wrap ->
	extra char at end of line ">"
carving
	enum: Top, Bottom, Left, Right, Rest
	number
	enum: rows/cols/percentage
	flags: visible, focus, wrap mode, scollbars
focus & panels should determine a key's action
	current panel gets notification
	if recjected (or uncaught) try other panels
	try panels in what order?
panels keep in internal cursor, so user can write many long (wrapped) lines
	and not worry.  The panel will display (optional) wrap chars
	or _not_ wrap, etc.  Eventually the user's write will soft-fail
	-> write beyond panel's size

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

send escape sequence to clear terminal title when mutt closes
init.h struct option_t needs enums for types and union for data
timer notifications, e.g.
	highlight something for three seconds, then return to normal
https://github.com/N8Fear/mutt-kz
	some initialisations improvements
	some bug fixes

set patch commit dates to patch-date
set commit dates to author dates
toggle-sidebar command

widestring folder names
	highlight broken (wrong width)
	are truncated because 3 bytes is only 2 spaces
	wcwidth() / wcswidth()
<stdbool.h> in sidebar.c
sidebar_delim
	change name to sidebar_dividers
	first (wide) character is vertical divider
		between sidebar and index/pager
	second (wide) character is horizontal divider
		between different mailboxes (within the sidebar)
sidebar_color
	background color for entire sidebar region?

need attention
	draw_sidebar
	OPTSIDEBARSORT
		sorts by real path, not visible name

check for unused #include
sort includes <>, ""

sort init.h, globals.h, etc

kill one-line if's:
	if (adsfa) command;

make_sidebar_entry leaks as string is passed to printw

~50 lines of commented out source
	/* ... ; */

possible to fix sidebar sort order to respect hierarchy/indentation?

for LONG list of mailboxes, need vim-style scroll-offset param to control paging
