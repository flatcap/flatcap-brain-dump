history - fix this:
	docs "The buffer is cleared each time the variable is set."

rename & move history to ~/.neomutt/history
	use config syntext to highlight?
	default to relative to user's neomuttrc

history needs a refurb
	doesn't quite save the right number of items
	lots of void fn(void)!
	when mkstemp() is in library, move history to library

history -1 => infinite

.mutthistory should be .neomutthistory
