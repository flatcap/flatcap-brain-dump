history - fix this:
	docs "The buffer is cleared each time the variable is set."

rename & move history to ~/.neomutt/history
	use config syntext to highlight?
	default to relative to user's neomuttrc

history needs a refurb
	doesn't quite save the right number of items
	lots of void fn(void)!
	when mkstemp() is in library, move history to library

history -1 => infinite

.mutthistory should be .neomutthistory

history has dupes between categories
try to recategorise to be more meaningful
e.g. mailbox, alias?
cross-contamination between prompts
need owner too

history sidebar
	"all" and each category
	commands/functions to de-dupe, sort, delete, add?, save
