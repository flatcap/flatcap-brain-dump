	fix block comments too

Whitespace

	align = (

Brackets space(space
Bang space!spaceVAR
Brace: kernel cuddle?  always around if/else etc

case brace {} check scopes

static functions -- all declared?

if's bracket anything more complex that ARG or !ARG
	maths too

grammar: its dont cant, spelling 's

Tidying actions

Comments on
	functions
	block
	removal of junk comments
	init.h functions

Indent
	our source files
	our functions in mutt source files
	our code lines in mutt functions

Indent
	tabs
	brackets whitespace
	brackets around complex logic
	braces, functions, if/while/etc, struct/enum/etc
	function definitions
		name parameters
	align =
	pointers X *x, !x
	trailing whitespace

Functions
	name consistently
	reorder, static then public
	name params sensibly

Unused
	remove structs
	remove params
	remove functions
	#if 0
	#include

Checks
	Init vars
	check pointers/all params
	retvals BOOL, compare with if (!fn())
	if ((x = y()) == NULL)
	logic if (x + y > 6)
	maths spacing _+_
	reserved words: new, this, etc

Make all lists derive from
	LIST *next
	or
	DLIST *next, *prev

init all vars
lots of static fns → _fn_name?
^L in source
Doxygen comments

strict compilation flags; c++ compiler?
unnamed args in function prototypes
spurious \ line endings (in middle of if!)

check for unused #include
sort includes <>, ""

sort init.h, globals.h, etc

kill one-line if's:
	if (adsfa) command;

~50 lines of commented out source
	/* ... ; */

cleanup:
	docs - in code and html
	comments
	whitespace
		unfold lines
		indent
		rebracket
		refold
	sort options in
		init.h
		globals.h
		functions.h
		switches
	doc switch drop-throughs

while(1), rather than FOREVER

check all headers #include requisites for compilation

sensible retvals on functions

code: switch default must be at end

BOOL -> enum?  what about the bitfields?

regex/regexp pick one in code/docs
	manual.xml
		regexp 65
		regex 7
	*.[ch]
		regexp 48
		regex 25

should static functions be called mutt_*?
check minor new functions are static

tidy - check files for leading/trailing whitespace at ends of file
	check for redundant empty lines

lots of preprocessor symbols that use #if on undefined symbols
	warning: "DEBUG" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "HAVE_DB4" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "HAVE_GDBM" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "HAVE_QDBM" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "SYS_SIGLIST_DECLARED" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "USE_UNLOCKED_IO" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "_STRING_ARCH_unaligned" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "__alpha" is not defined [-Wundef]
	warning: "__sun__" is not defined [-Wundef]

macros() should be MACROS()

smime.c:
	variable set to NULL after safe_fclose
	safe_fclose (&smimeout);
	smimeout = NULL;

check everyone's using safe_fopen(), safe_fclose(), etc

rename safe_X(**ptr) to X_null?
	safe_free -> free_null (**ptr)
		-> free_n ()
		-> n_free ()
		-> free_and_null ()

change prototypes for the X_and_NULL macros
	free() doesn't take a double pointer, so
	FREE() shouldn't
	rule of least surprise

try to reduce the scope of all variables
	too many variables are declared at the start of a function
	when they only get used in an if/for/while loop

#define mutt_new_header() safe_calloc (1, sizeof (HEADER))
	et al ought to cast their returns to the correct type

lots of pointers being assiged to 0
	unsigned char *pending_exact = 0;
        should be NULL

wiki coding style:
	indent, {}s, ()s, function defs, examples of correct

clang all my code + fix warnings

mvprintw unused?

purge all macros from neomutt?

sizeof(x) vs sizeof x

puts() and _() missing ()s

drop #if HAVE_CONFIG_H / #endif around #include "config.h"
	it's a compulsory part of our build

mutt_new_header() -> safe_*
	because it can't fail?

drop regex.c (after reformatting phase?)

#defines → enums?

check minors for () -> (void)

find untranslated strings, i.e. missing _()
	mutt -v output is missing some

rename variables to be sensible

buf vs buff

test iwyi - include what you use
