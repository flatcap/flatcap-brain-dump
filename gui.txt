all addch, printw to go through mutt_win() functions
	check for visible, save colour and position?

MuttWindow separate Window-y from drawing primitives
	mutt_win_* vs mutt_window_*? urgh!
	just separate prototypes

isendwin, endwin -> curses is_gui_mode(), end_gui_mode()
tree symbols -> curses init, exported global

libgui (after nested windows)
	curses, windows, not colours?
	all drawing through windows
	no curses outside of libgui?
	where/how do colours/attrs fit in?
	who parses? who stores?
	eliminate OptNoCurses

gui modes: normal, alternate, disable
	or YES, NO, BATCH
	or NORMAL, GUI, BATCH
what about messages in backends?
	if (!OptCurses) mutt_message()
