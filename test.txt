need EBNF/ABNF âˆ€ config, text entry
config files: all commands (87)
all entry fields
all config (431)
49 command functions
config by type and subtype
EBNF as a tree of validity
	deviate => wrong & parse failure

color object fg bg
"color" fixed
object: from a fixed list
fg, bg: color-spec
color-spec: "red", "color123", "#xxxxxx" (future)
	"bright", etc
mono attrs too: list

tests âˆ€ valid input
tests for invalid input in every position
specify errors âˆ€ invalids tests?
	maybe debug only
E123 invalid color
individual error msgs, but all linked to E123

wrong: string not in list, number out of range, too few args, too many args, not a number

change void fn() -> retval -> easier testing
eliminate void fn(void) globals -> act on something -> testable
