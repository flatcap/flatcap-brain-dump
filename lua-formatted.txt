This is a list of everything I could think to script.
There's a lot of overlap / recurring themes.
Some of the ideas are sensible, some not :-)

## General

**All scripts would be passed:**
- neomutt version string
- current date

**Have access to functions:**
- patch_supported()

## Config

Allow script to be embedded in normal Mutt config files, e.g. like PHP:

**Pass in:**
- username
- user's home dir
- current config file
- line number

```lua
<?lua
	if (MUTT_VERSION > "20160916") then
		mutt_config("set sidebar_visible")
	end
?>
```

Lua's print() function could be overridden to call mutt_message()

## Index

A one-pass processing of the mailbox.
Call the script once for each email.

Add new expandos, %L1, %L2, etc to be filled by the script.

**Pass in:**
- Copy of all the fields
- Current account
- Current mailbox
- Current email

**Define functions to:**
- Colour:
  * All of the line
  * One field
  * Regex on field, or line
- Modify a field (‡)
- Hide / Delete an email (‡)
- Set the fold level of thread
- Set score of email
- Lookup address -- is_alias()
- Add/remove icon for email
  * Flag GitHub notifications
  * Add coloured stars

Can optionally disable Mutt's colouring

## Pager

A one-pass processing of an email.
Call the script once for each line.

**Define functions to:**
- Query the headers
- Colour all, or part, of the line
  * Look for markers like "^diff"
  * Look for a signature: "-- "
  * Heuristics for languages
- Modify a line (‡)
- Hide / Delete a line (‡)
- Insert a new line (‡)
- Set the fold level

‡ Actions are non-destructive

## Sidebar

Sidebar mailbox entries
**Define functions to:**
- Colour all, or part, of the line
- Visibility - hide a mailbox
- Modify a mailbox name (‡)
- Change Counts of: flagged, read, total emails (‡)

‡ Actions are non-destructive

**e.g.**
- Hide folders with no new mail
- Emails in "drafts" are always unread

## Hooks

**These hooks might be useful to override with a script:**
- account-hook
- close-hook
- folder-hook
- reply-hook
- send-hook
- timeout-hook

Most useful, would be a new-mail-hook.

**Pass it:**
- Account info
- Mailbox info
- Email headers
- Current date
- Size
- Number of attachments
- List of attachments

**Allow it a small set of functions:**
- set_flag: read, flagged
- set_score
- email: move, copy, delete
- search body
- search attachment
- stop processing

## Status Bar

Generate: $status_format, $ts_status_format

**Pass info about current:**
- account
- mailbox
- email
- max length

## Testing framework

**Need to expose:**
- index functions
- sidebar functions
- variables

**Be able to:**
- call functions
- send keystrokes
- get error codes returned from functions
- save the results

**Automation:**
- Run tests on Travis
- Need public access to test mailboxes

Create a test rig, built from Mutt code, that takes a mailbox and a script.
- test-rig test.mbox config.lua
- machine-parseable output
