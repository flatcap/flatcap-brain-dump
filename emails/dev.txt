Subject: Development, 1.5.24, 1.6.0

Now that 1.6.0 is out, I have some questions about development.

Is 1.5.24 finished?

What's the plan?

Is the 1.5 branch finished?
Will 1.5.24 get bug-fixes?
Is the advice: update to 1.6.0?

will mutt-1.5.24 receive any more fixes?
or is the advice to move to 1.6.0

*REAL* dev branch?  or am *I* the dev branch?

1.5.24 vs 1.6.0
workflow?
stable?
when?
what?
