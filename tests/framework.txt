Test Framework

Test what?
Test how?

Options:
        no curses
        fake curses
        test harness (no main)

Testing #if DEBUG

Makefile
        make test
        make testX

need to control random source(s)
        message ids need to be predictable
        what else is random?

fake curses -- list ALL uses of curses
        reduce / centralise all uses of curses
        fake COLS, LINES, WINCH
        => possible REAL gui!
