Test Framework

Test what?
Test how?

Options:
        no curses
        fake curses
        test harness (no main)

Testing #if DEBUG

Makefile
        make test
        make testX

need to control random source(s)
        message ids need to be predictable
        what else is random?

fake curses -- list ALL uses of curses
        reduce / centralise all uses of curses
        fake COLS, LINES, WINCH
        => possible REAL gui!

testing
	create a list of very simple tests
	simple instructions
	simple outcome
	each item, tests ONE thing
	create large list
	split list (randomly?) amongst testers

tests:
	set all config options to: valid, invalid, empty
	both in muttrc and within mutt

mutt test framework
	how?

create tests âˆ€ issues to prevent regressions
	HOW?
