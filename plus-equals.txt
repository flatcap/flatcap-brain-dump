easy task

new $vartype "letters" == STRING (or letter-list or string-list)
can any other vars be promoted to string-lists? (or letter-lists?)
	for "set var += X"  add X
	or  "set var -= Y"  delete Y
	or  "set var != Z"  toggle Z

multiple letters/strings?
	set var += XY (or X,Y)   for letters
	set var -= apple,banana  for strings
	set var != cherry,damson for strings

+= / -= works for strings, letters, numbers
	what about *= /=
	~= regexes performed on strings?

all numeric fields
set nm_hidden_tags = "unread,draft,flagged,passed,replied,attachment,signed,encrypted"

vim-style
	set += val
		add number
		append string
	set ^= val
		multiply numbers
		prepend string
