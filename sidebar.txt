Sidebar 2

Need top-level SOURCEs: Mail, Notmuch, NNTP, Address book, RSS?

Either separate modes: one or other SRC
One open, others listed at bottom (folded)
Full folder metaphor: user controls what's visible
	=> could need ability to "limit" folders/entries to manage size

Mail SRC represents each mail source: Local, POP3, IMAP, etc
	user can have multiple of any SRC
	inc. multitple email accounts
	     multitple address books, etc

Use 2nd divider character for horizontal separator
	or drop completely and use a bool: ASCII vs Unicode
	and draw the lines properly

=> No more sidebar_format... need:
	sb_mail_format
	sb_notmuch_format
	sb_nntp_format
	sb_addressbook_format
	sb_rss_format
