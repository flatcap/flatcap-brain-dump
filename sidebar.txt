Sidebar 2

Need top-level SOURCEs: Mail, Notmuch, NNTP, Address book, RSS?

Either separate modes: one or other SRC
One open, others listed at bottom (folded)
Full folder metaphor: user controls what's visible
	=> could need ability to "limit" folders/entries to manage size

Mail SRC represents each mail source: Local, POP3, IMAP, etc
	user can have multiple of any SRC
	inc. multitple email accounts
	     multitple address books, etc

Use 2nd divider character for horizontal separator
	or drop completely and use a bool: ASCII vs Unicode
	and draw the lines properly

=> No more sidebar_format... need:
	sb_mail_format
	sb_notmuch_format
	sb_nntp_format
	sb_addressbook_format
	sb_rss_format

Full office suite -- manage anything texty

SRC: Address book
	backend: files, db, ldap, google
	integrated with email: "add to address book", "complete from address book"

SRC: Calendar
	backend? files, db, ldap, google
	brief calendar in sidebar
	expanded work area in main panel
	integrated with email: e.g. "create event from email (scan for dates)"

SRC: tasks
	backend: files, db, ldap, google
	integrated with email: e.g. "turn email into task"

fewer sidebar_ variables
	width
	divider_chars
rest are SRC-dependent

âˆ€ SRCn::init() call sb_register_source (name, callbacks)
sidebar function sb_select_source(name)

SRC provides sb with list of BUFFYs
	who provides the sorting?
	different SRCs will have different requirements
sb displays, paginates, delegates open to SRC

src_mailboxes
src_addresses
src_notmuch	or src_searching
src_calendar
src_rss

functions: curs_main -> sb -> SRCx, SRCy, SRCz

SRC: Calendar
	sb displays: day, week, n-week, month, n-month, year
	functions: page up/down dependent on view
		next/prev - day, week, etc
		goto date
		search event
	mail panel - grid view, agenda view => panel manager (cal_panel)
	tie in calendar to addressbook: birthdays, anniversaries, etc

SRC: Addresses
	sb displays - categories/tags, search results, etc
	main panel displays full records, or contents of selected category
	categories/tags can be expanded in sb
	people can be in multiple/zero categories/tags -- need top-level for unclassified people
	src_add could need extra panel
		sb1: tags
		sb2: list of tagged people
		sb3: selected person
