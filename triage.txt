project jobs:
	issue triager/splitter

triage:
	base issue becomes the discussion board
		create a matching project
	triaged into tasks
		notes on the project
	developer adopts one
		note -> issue (devel)
		assigned to them
		[devel/*]
	completed
		issue (release)

projects triage notes need
	dependencies info
	ordering
	number note sequentially
	use these numbers
	update when note becomes and issue

after we add issue/pr templates
triager should edit out the dross
fix links, light formatting?

thank the reporter

try to repeat the problem
	sample config
	steps to reproduce
	tag: confirm
	test old versions
		have bin of each release (inc mutt)
		tag: regression

check old/quiet issues -- still relevant
