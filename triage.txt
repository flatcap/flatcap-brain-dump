project jobs:
	issue triager/splitter

triage:
	base issue becomes the discussion board
		create a matching project
	triaged into tasks
		notes on the project
	developer adopts one
		note -> issue (devel)
		assigned to them
		[devel/*]
	completed
		issue (release)

projects triage notes need
	dependencies info
	ordering
	number note sequentially
	use these numbers
	update when note becomes and issue

after we add issue/pr templates
triager should edit out the dross
fix links, light formatting?
